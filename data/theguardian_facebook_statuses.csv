Watch the video clip in full here. Missy Higgins says the animated video, which includes drawings by refugee children in Damascus and Beirut, ""also reminds people of what happened to Alan and his family [..] after what they went through they don't deserve to be forgotten"".  ""In this song, 'Canada' represents anywhere in the world that might be the preferred sanctuary for people like the Kurdi's. Amongst other countries, it represents Australia which has such an abhorrent record in dealing with people seeking asylum who try to travel to our shores by boat.""
