Celine's current manager, Aldo Giampaolo, was Executive Vice-President and General Manager of the Molson Centre at the time. He is credited with the concept of transforming a sports arena into a venue suitable for an intimate concert atmosphere. The first song that Celine sang that evening was ""J'attendais"", from the album 'D'eux'. She was forced to pause during the performance because of the standing ovation she received from the audience.
That night would be the 1st of 34 performances Celine has given at the Molson Centre, which eventually became the Bell Centre in September 2002. She will be back this summer to give 10 additional concerts for all her Montreal fans!

Andre-Philippe has been the opening act of several of Celine's shows in the past and was a triumph each time: in Europe, the United States, and Canada during the ""Let's Talk About Love"" tour in 1998.

Celine and Ren√© always enjoyed the exceptional talent of Andre-Philippe, and Andre-Philippe has kept these unforgettable memories as a highlight of his career.
