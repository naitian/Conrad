367152833370567_1030323307053513,"Weekend Hashtag Project: #WHParchitecture

The goal this weekend is to photograph architecture, and will be curated by Shoair Mavlian (instagram.com/shoair_m), photography curator of the Tate Modern museum (instagram.com/tate) in London, which is celebrating the opening of its new building, the Switch House, today.

""Architecture is present everywhere in our everyday surroundings ‚Äî from cutting-edge museum buildings and towering glass office blocks to bus stops, schools and sports stadiums,"" says Shoair. ""The world looks very different if we stop, rethink (and photograph!) the everyday examples which surround us."" 

Here is how Shoair says to get started:

Focus on the different ways buildings and landmarks affect you. ""Architectural structures play an important role in our everyday lives, from the private spaces we share with family to communal spaces we work or study in to shared public spaces we use to gather and come together,"" says Shoair.

Step back to show buildings within the context of their landscapes and surroundings (whether a skyscraper towering over an urban skyline or a thatched-roof house in the middle of an open field).

Don't forget to go inside the spaces you photograph to capture interesting details in walls, doorways and stairwells ‚Äî as well as the people that inhabit or utilize the space.

PROJECT RULES: Please add the #WHParchitecture hashtag only to photos and videos taken over this weekend and only submit your own visuals to the project. If you include music in your submissions, please only use music to which you own the rights. Any tagged visual taken over the weekend is eligible to be featured next week.

The goal this weekend is to get up close and personal with your subject ‚Äî whether a person, animal or whatever it is you like to photograph. The project takes inspiration from New York-based fashion photographer Landon Nordeman (instagram.com/landonnordeman), who will be our guest curator.

""There's this very joyful aspect of what photographers and Instagrammers are doing, which is that they're saying, 'I appreciate this thing,' or, 'I appreciate this person, this view,'"" says Landon. ""I love this idea that photography is an act of appreciation.""

Here is how Landon suggests making images that feel more intimate:

Learn more about your subjects as you shoot. ""I'm curious about people, and I like to talk to people,"" he says. ""Sometimes you have to shoot first and then you engage or talk."" 

Photograph a variety of subjects. ""Instead of going out and executing your preconceived notion of what you want, try and find something that in a way surprises you or something you haven't thought of before.""

Pay attention to every moment in a scene. ""Anywhere in a sequence there can be an interesting picture."" 

PROJECT RULES: Please add the #WHPgetclose hashtag only to photos and videos taken over this weekend and only submit your own visuals to the project. If you include music in your submissions, please only use music to which you own the rights. Any tagged visual taken over the weekend is eligible to be featured next week.

367152833370567_1022538391165338,"Weekend Hashtag Project: #WHPoverunder

The goal this weekend is to take photos and videos of everyday scenes from especially high or low angles ‚Äî like this one by @itala_marques.

Here are some ideas to get started:

Get playful with perspective. Make a tiny object appear larger than life from a low angle or dwarf a giant scene into tiny specks by shooting from above.

Location is everything. Shoot from spots that put you greatly above your subject (like the top floor of a skyscraper or a double-decker bus) or below (like from a beach under a bridge or the floor of your bedroom).

Include points of interest in the foreground, middle ground and background of your frames to exaggerate the sense of scale in your images even more.

PROJECT RULES: Please add the #WHPoverunder hashtag only to photos and videos taken over this weekend and only submit your own visuals to the project. If you include music in your submissions, please only use music to which you own the rights. Any tagged visual taken over the weekend is eligible to be featured next week.

The goal this weekend is to make creative videos of the animal kingdom ‚Äî like this one by @paulapaulova.

Here are some ideas to get started:

Showcase your pet's personality by capturing them in their element ‚Äì whether that's mid-Frisbee in the backyard or curled up in a favorite nook.

Take a furry friend on a neighborhood adventure, and record your route with Instagram's Hyperlapse app.

Don't forget about animals in the wild! Explore the sights and sounds of nature like birds chirping in pine trees or dolphins breaching at the coast. 

PROJECT RULES: Please add the #WHPwildthings hashtag only to videos taken over this weekend and only submit your own visuals to the project. If you include music in your submissions, please only use music to which you own the rights. Any tagged video taken over the weekend is eligible to be featured next week.

Today is #FoodRevolutionDay, an event created by chef Jamie Oliver to drive positive change in food education and public health. To celebrate, the goal of this weekend's project is to make photos and videos using healthy, fresh food in creative ways. 

Here are some ideas to get started:

Visit  a local farmers market, and pick up ingredients based on color and quirkiness. 

Cook your favorite healthy dish, and style it in a new way ‚Äî as a face or picture ‚Äî or stage a scene entirely out of good-for-you snacks.

Bring fruits and vegetables to life in a playful #Boomerang or video.

PROJECT RULES: Please add the #WHPedibleart hashtag only to photos and videos taken over this weekend and only submit your own visuals to the project. If you include music in your video submissions, please only use music to which you own the rights. Any tagged photo or video taken over the weekend is eligible to be featured next week.

The goal this weekend is to look for moments of beauty in unexpected places. The project takes inspiration from guest curator Isabel Martinez (instagram.com/isabelitavirtual), a creative director and photographer based in New York.

Isabel is known for her fashion images, characterized by strong lines and bold colors with an air of mystery. ""I always work in the same direction, which is trying to capture what is hidden, a kind of poetry,"" says Isabel.

Here are Isabel's tips to get started:

Look for interesting scenes in everyday moments: ""We are surrounded by beauty ‚Äî it depends on you to see where it is.""

Focus on photographing details without showing the entire scene: ""For me, the most interesting photo is when the viewer is able to add part of the missing information from his own experience.""

PROJECT RULES: Please add the #WHPhiddenbeauty hashtag only to photos and videos taken over this weekend and only submit your own visuals to the project. If you include music in your video submissions, please only use music to which you own the rights. Any tagged photo or video taken over the weekend is eligible to be featured next week.

367152833370567_1002213379864506,"Weekend Hashtag Project: #WHPdaydream

The goal this weekend is to make surreal photos and videos inspired by your dreams ‚Äî like this one by @una_blue. Here's how to get started:

Stage a reality- or gravity-defying moment, like tossing objects into the air to make them appear as if they're magically floating.

Create a psychedelic dreamscape by shooting through tinted materials or turning your camera for a distorted perspective.

If shooting video, consider a plot twist that transforms an ordinary situation into a fantasy.

PROJECT RULES: Please add the #WHPdaydream hashtag only to photos and videos taken over this weekend and only submit your own visuals to the project. If you include music in your video submissions, please only use music to which you own the rights. Any tagged photo or video taken over the weekend is eligible to be featured next week.

For more examples and inspiration, check out the Instagram blog: blog.instagram.com/post/143597932052/160429-whp-219

The goal this week is to make photos and videos that capture people and objects in motion. Here's how to get started:

Head to busy areas with people in transit ‚Äî like urban intersections or crowds in a colorful marketplace.

Find a safe way to capture the view from your bicycle riding down a mountain trail or a speeding train zipping through the city.

Try using Instagram's Hyperlapse app to share a longer journey from beginning to end.

PROJECT RULES: Please add the #WHPonthego hashtag only to photos and videos taken over this weekend and only submit your own visuals to the project. If you include music in your video submissions, please only use music to which you own the rights. Any tagged photo or video taken over the weekend is eligible to be featured next week.

367152833370567_989793091106535,"Weekend Hashtag Project: #WHPlightandshadow

The goal this weekend is to make photos and videos highlighting the contrast of light and shadow. Here's how to get started:

Seek out uniquely shaped shadows cast by a variety of objects ‚Äî like spots of light pouring through the holes of a straw sun hat.

If shooting at night, play with using a heavy flash or fluorescent lights to create especially high-contrast imagery. 

Use props to cast your own playful shadows, and capture them moving in creative ways through video.

PROJECT RULES: Please add the #WHPlightandshadow hashtag only to photos and videos taken over this weekend and only submit your own visuals to the project. If you include music in your video submissions, please only use music to which you own the rights. Any tagged photo or video taken over the weekend is eligible to be featured next week.

The goal this weekend is to make videos starring your favorite foods and cooking techniques, like this one by @bliu07. Here's how to get started:

Make a step-by-step video showing your process. For example: rolling out, cutting and decorating a batch of cookies.

Step outside the kitchen to explore other stories that can be told through food, whether it's exploring local gardens for fresh produce or focusing on the way friends come together for a meal.

Get playful! Bring food to life as characters with faces or seek out colorful ingredients to bring a plated meal to life.

PROJECT RULES: Please add the #WHPfoodfilms hashtag only to photos and videos taken over this weekend and only submit your own visuals to the project. If you include music in your video submissions, please only use music to which you own the rights. Any tagged photo or video taken over the weekend is eligible to be featured next week.

The goal this weekend is to capture expression in all its forms ‚Äî like this one by @merypace. Here's how to get started:

Wait for a moment that will lead to a strong reaction, like a surprise birthday party or the reveal of a magic trick.

Bring your camera to a public space, like the beach or a local park, to capture a variety of lively behaviors in a single image.

Try using Boomerang to isolate a quirky habit, like a friend twirling her hair or a curious pet.

PROJECT RULES: Please add the #WHPexpressions hashtag only to photos and videos taken over this weekend and only submit your own visuals to the project. Any tagged photo or video taken over the weekend is eligible to be featured next week.

For more examples and inspiration, check out blog.instagram.com.

When I climb, I'm able to just release everything from my mind ‚Äî I feel in control of everything that's happening around me.

Since I've started climbing, I've won nine national youth titles, a youth world championship title and the 2015 adult national championship, but I hope to become an adult world champion. It's really exciting and a privilege to be a role model for people that are younger than me.

In my community, it's not very common to like rock climbing ‚Äî the fact that I'm excelling at it, I feel, is really different. But it could be inspiring to other people. I think it's okay to be different, and we shouldn't associate different with uncool.""

The goal this weekend is to look for patterns in your surroundings, both naturally occurring and man-made. Here's how to get started:

Focus on highlighting the repetition of identifiable shapes in your scene.

Look for patterns large and small in scale ‚Äî whether zooming in close to the subtle lines on a flower petal or photographing the smokestacks of an industrial site from a distance.

Try using video to capture moving patterns ‚Äî like a line of ants marching in unison through your backyard.

PROJECT RULES: Please add the #WHPpatterns hashtag only to photos and videos taken over this weekend and only submit your own visuals to the project. Any tagged photo or video taken over the weekend is eligible to be featured next week.

For more examples and inspiration, check out the Instagram blog: blog.instagram.com/post/141273316762/160318-whp-214

367152833370567_969002359852275,"Weekend Hashtag Project: #WHPeyetricks

The goal this weekend is to create optical illusions by playing with perspective and scale in your photos and videos ‚Äî like this one by @el.rex. Here's how to get started: 

Focus on making visuals that depict seemingly impossible situations ‚Äî like your own hand picking up a skyscraper, or the sun resting atop a friend's head.

Shoot from a variety of perspectives so objects appear smaller or larger in your images than in real life. For example, make a toy action figure look life-size by shooting it from close-up and at a low angle.

Place objects on different planes in your frame to warp the sense of scale. Keep in mind that whatever's in the foreground of your picture will appear the largest.

PROJECT RULES: Please add the #WHPeyetricks hashtag only to photos and videos taken over this weekend and only submit your own visuals to the project. Any tagged photo or video taken over the weekend is eligible to be featured next week.

For more examples and inspiration, check out the Instagram blog: blog.instagram.com/post/140875857937/160311-whp-213

""A camera requires full commitment,"" he says. ""But my phone is always with me. This way I almost always manage to catch a good scene instantly."" Some of his work, however, is quite deliberate. Lesha manipulates his photos by utilizing unexpected elements in his environment. ""I was in the middle of apartment refurbishment, the room was covered in plastic sheeting, the sun was shining through and it was just amazing,"" he says. ""Ever since, I always keep a piece of plastic with me. If you press it against the camera, you get a blur effect."" This layering is essential to Lesha's creative approach: ""I want to rhyme the beauty, to transform it, rather than take it literally.""

I started to like it a lot more ‚Äî and now I'm literally in love with it.

My goal for the day is just to put down a good run, and be stoked with my riding. For the future, I want to learn a lot more tricks and stuff, maybe even do some slopestyle next year.

The goal this weekend is to make videos with interesting ambient (or natural) sound, like this one by @hummingbirdsxoxo. Here's how to get started:

Close your eyes and let your ears lead you to your subject.

Listen for sounds that set the mood ‚Äî like the upbeat squeak of sneakers sliding on a basketball court or the calming tones of church bells ringing in the morning.

Let the ambient noise guide the visual component of the video. For example, try panning your camera to slowly reveal the source of sound at the end.

PROJECT RULES: Please add the #WHPsightsandsounds hashtag only to videos taken over this weekend and only submit your own visuals to the project. Any tagged video taken over the weekend is eligible to be featured next week.

For more examples and inspiration, check out the Instagram blog: blog.instagram.com/post/140049205497/160226-whp-211

Of those potted plants, ""Cacti No. 1"" (#„Çµ„Éú‰∏ÄÂè∑) remains one of her favorites among the 150 she now keeps at her home in Japan's Hyogo prefecture. ""I never really grew plants until then, nor had I seen an actual cactus flower before,"" Michie explains. ""I was amazed at the big white flower that bloomed on Cacti No. 1, and that's how my collection of succulents started."" Michie is drawn to the genus' slow and gradual development over time. ""Each plant has different growth cycles, and I like to take pictures when a plant is in its phase of change ‚Äî a state I like to call 'in action.'""
