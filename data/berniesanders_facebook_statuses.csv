I intend to do everything that I can to prevent United Technologies from shutting down their plants and throwing 2,100 workers out on the street and moving abroad where they will pay workers $3 an hour.

This is a company that in 2014 provided its retired CEO, Louis Schenevert, with a golden parachute of $172 million – including a pension worth $31 million. And they apparently got rid of him because he was doing a bad job! Imagine what they would have given him if he was doing a good job.

This is a company that could afford to pay its new CEO more than $14 million in total compensation last year.

This is a company which made a profit of more than $7 billion last year.

This is a company that received $6 billion in defense contracts last year from the taxpayers of this country.

This is a company that in 2009 received $121 million in federal tax credits designed specifically to keep green manufacturing jobs in the United States.

And this is a company that has received more than $58 million in corporate welfare from the Export-Import Bank. That is unacceptable.

The greed of United Technologies is almost unbelievable. You can't make this stuff up. They have no shame.

Today, we need to send a very loud and very clear message to the CEO of United Technologies: Stop the greed. Stop destroying the middle class in America. Respect your workers. Respect the American people.

Bernie believes it's necessary to break up large financial institutions not only because we need to prevent another Wall Street bailout, but because of the incredible concentration of ownership and power that now rest with a handful of these huge institutions. 

Within the first 100 days of his administration, Bernie will require the secretary of the Treasury Department to establish a ""Too-Big-to Fail"" list of commercial banks, shadow banks and insurance companies whose failure would pose a catastrophic risk to the United States economy without a taxpayer bailout.

Within a year, the Sanders administration will work with the Federal Reserve and financial regulators to break these institutions up using the authority of Section 121 of the Dodd-Frank Act.

Bernie will also fight to enact a 21st Century Glass-Steagall Act to clearly separate commercial banking, investment banking and insurance services. Sec. Clinton opposes this extremely important measure.

President Franklin Roosevelt signed the Glass-Steagall Act into law precisely to prevent Wall Street speculators from causing another Great Depression. And, it worked for more than five decades until Wall Street watered it down under President Reagan and killed it under President Clinton.

I predicted that the passage of this disastrous trade deal would make it easier, not harder, for the wealthy and large corporations to evade taxes by sheltering billions of dollars offshore. I wish I had been proven wrong about this, but it has now come to light that the extent of Panama's tax avoidance scams is even worse than I had feared.

My opponent, on the other hand, opposed this trade agreement when she was running against Barack Obama for president in 2008. But when it really mattered she quickly reversed course and helped push the Panama Free Trade Agreement through Congress as Secretary of State. The results have been a disaster.

The American people are sick and tired of establishment politicians who say one thing during a campaign and do the exact opposite the day after the election.

It is time for real change. As president, I will use my authority to terminate the Panama Free Trade Agreement within six months.

Check out the Panama Papers released by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists. They show that over 214,000 offshore companies are using tax havens in Panama to evade taxes. This includes 500 banks which have registered over 15,000 shell companies in Panama. That is unacceptable and that has got to change.

Sadly, Secretary Clinton made this tax evasion worse by supporting the Panama Free Trade Agreement in 2011, even though she opposed it when she was running for President against Barack Obama in 2008.  

Bernie, on the other hand, opposed this disastrous trade deal from day one. During the debate over the Panama trade deal in 2011, Senator Sanders said on the floor of the Senate: ""Panama is a world leader when it comes to allowing wealthy Americans and large corporations to evade U.S. taxes by stashing their cash in offshore tax havens. And the Panama Free Trade Agreement would make this bad situation much worse ... The trade agreement with Panama would effectively bar the United States from cracking down on illegal and abusive offshore tax havens in Panama. In fact, combating tax haven abuse in Panama would be a violation of this free-trade agreement, exposing the United States to fines from international authorities.""

Now she says she wants to make it tougher for automobiles to be imported to this country under the disastrous Trans-Pacific Partnership. That's the deal she called the 'gold standard' when she was Secretary of State.

Well, I have a message for Secretary Clinton: We shouldn't re-negotiate the Pacific trade proposal. We should kill this unfettered free-trade agreement which would cost us nearly half a million jobs.

We don't need to tinker with this agreement. We need to defeat it. We need an entirely new trade policy that creates jobs in this country, not more low-wage jobs abroad.

Secretary Clinton could have stopped a trade deal that threatens hundreds of thousands of jobs last year when it was being debated in Congress. Instead, she chose to remain silent and forced working families, unions and members of Congress to fight against the world's biggest corporations and the most powerful special interests in the country without her support.
