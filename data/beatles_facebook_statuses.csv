(…) We came in from the airport - it was the same in Liverpool for the premiere of A Hard Day's Night, with the whole city centre full of people - and the crowds were lining the route and we were giving them the thumbs up. And then we went to the Adelaide town hall with the Lord Mayor there, and gave the thumbs up again.

Although ""Revolution"" was released first, it was recorded several weeks after ""Revolution 1"" as a re-make specifically designed to be released as a single.

You near it now and it doesn't sound too bad; but it'd make me cringe. If you find me the A track and I remix it, I'll show you what it is really, but you can hear it there. It's a heavy record and the drums are heavy too. That's why I like it."" - John, from The Beatles Anthology.

He said, 'Yeah, but I'll be able to sell these to eyeglass magazines all over the world.' We were getting all these little clues of how it was done.

'I Want to Hold Your Hand' was the first Beatles' record to top both the UK and the US charts. It was also their first to be recorded on a 4-track, as opposed to the usual 2-track, tape machine. The Beatles had the song well rehearsed when they made the first of 17 takes on October 17th 1963. 

Following The Beatles' historic appearance on The Ed Sullivan show on February 9th, the single – already at No.1 in the charts – gained further momentum. They taped a performance of the song earlier in the day of their live appearance and it was shown on the Sullivan show of February 23rd, which helped maintain the song's popularity. This avalanche of publicity, engineered by Brian Epstein, helped the single to stay at the top for seven weeks, which made it the longest-running No.1 of their career to date (until 'Hey Jude').

Wonfor, the director of the Anthology documentary series, filmed the Beatles recording in the studio and Godley combined this with archive footage of the band, adding some animated sequences as well as film he shot in 1995. This clip appeared in the special features section of The Beatles Anthology boxed set when it was released on DVD on 2003.

For the many who witnessed The Beatles' early appearances on British television, this song is synonymous with those exciting era–defining times. The power of the band's performances and the recording owes so much to John's searing vocal. For their debut album, John recorded his vocal in one take at the end of a marathon recording session on February 11th 1963. 

In July 1963, 'Twist And Shout' became the title track of the band's first EP to be released in the UK. According to the advert on the front of New Musical Express, it was ""The record you've been asking for"". A week after Twist And Shout was released it made the EP best-seller list and a week after that topped the same chart staying there for ten weeks. This clip was videotaped in the middle of a six-night run at the Odeon Cinema in Llandudno, North Wales.
