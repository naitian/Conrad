And on a personal level, the NFL life of the character I play (Spencer Strasmore) was the life I worked hard for YEARS to attain. I failed at it. But in many ways, the characters life is also the life I'm blessed with having today. It's a crazy DNA connection.

With great ambition can often come with great pain. And lots of f*cking hard living laughs along the way.

Want to thank my bud director/writer Shane Black and his writing team Anthony Bagarozzi and Chuck Mondry for flying in from LA and sitting with me and our Seven Bucks Productions's producer Hiram Garcia on this Memorial Day weekend to chop up creative and break story on this very cool project.

Comic book fans around the world know that the cool thing about ""Doc"" Savage is that he's the inspiration for Superman. First name Clark, called ""Man of Bronze"", retreats to his ""Fortress of Solitude"" in the Arctic etc etc.

Doc was physically and mentally trained from birth by his father and a team of scientists to become the perfect human specimen with a genius level intellect. His heightened senses are beyond comprehension. He can even identify a women's perfume from half a mile away. He is literally the master of everything. 
But here's the #1 reason I'm excited to become Doc Savage.. HE'S A F*CKING HILARIOUS WEIRDO!

Confidently, yet innocently he has zero social graces whatsoever due to his upbringing so every interaction he has with someone is direct, odd, often uncomfortable and amazingly hilarious.

After speaking for hours w/ Shane Black I can see why the creator of Superman took only the best parts of Doc Savage and leaving the ""weirdo"" part behind. But to us, it's that ""weirdo"" part that makes Clark ""Doc"" Savage dope! Can't wait to sink my teeth into this one of a kind character.

When you strip a man of all he has. All that's important to him. You force him to return to his roots.. and sometimes that's a very dangerous and twisted place.

If I was going to return for another Fast & Furious I wanted to come in and disrupt the franchise in a cool way that got fans fired up and their blood pumping to see a new version of Hobbs and his ""Daddy's gotta go to work"" mentality and set the table in a cool way for where the character goes in the future.

Maybe it's a spinoff movie. Maybe it's more #FF movies. Or hell maybe Hobbs just gets on his motorcycle and rides off into the sunset never to be seen again. 

Either way, I've had a solid first week of shooting, good to be back with the ohana, good to work again w/ my bud and director F.

And as is the case with our history. Every era, every revolution, every triumphant moment and every heartbreak has a distinct sound and song that can transport us right back to that moment in time.

Our #SevenBucksProductions and #ShowofForce are proud to bring you a new CNN Original Series called #Soundtracks: SONGS THAT MADE HISTORY.

We're taking you on an extraordinary journey through history using the music that defined our country's biggest moments.

We delivered the pilot to CNN, which included iconic artists from Billy Joel, to Lee Greenwood to Patti LeBelle who all sat with us to speak on how their music defined and inspired our country post 9/11. Incredibly moving and inspiring pilot and many tears shed (not me of course, I'm too tough to cry). CNN immediately ordered an entire series.

This is a passion, heart and soul project for our Seven Bucks Productions and Show Of Force. I think we're making something very cool, high quality and special for you to enjoy. Coming soon.

We did a lot together over the years.. worked out, drank, laughed, cried, had fun telling dumb jokes and yet thru it all, regardless of the challenges he would face, he would always ALWAYS have a smile on his face and he'd text me ""Like you big bro I'm being strong"".

Only drawback with this tank work, is when we shoot on the beach - I'm an energetic animal and feed off the energy of our hard working extras and fans watching. In this case the only thing I have to look at is Zac Efron and his 36 pack of ripped abs. F*cking boring.

We've spent over a year engineering this app for you. Our goal was create a free, direct, uncomplicated, cool, motivating app to help us all get after our goals and chase greatness..and always have fun along the way. 
I also wanted to totally disrupt the traditional ""morning alarm"" system we all use on our phones. We created fun, cheesy bad assery alarm tones (yes, that's me really singing and playing guitar to wake your ass up;) and one of my favorite features of the Rock Clock is the dreaded snooze button does not exist. 

Absolutely BEST part of Rock Clock is that I'll be able to track all your goals and you'll track mine. Some we'll succeed at and some we won't, but the fun part is together we'll chase our greatness.

Enjoy the free app, share your goals with me and world by using the hashtag #ProjectRock. I'll be shouting you guys out personally via video messages on this app, so let's chase our greatness, get after it and have fun along the way.

He's had one request. Meet me.

He spent the day with me on our Baywatch Movie set. Watched me film and in between scenes we'd hang out, have some laughs and have some good talks.

One of the good talks we had was about every time he goes into the hospital for treatments he takes two things: his Rock action figure (which I'm holding) and his stuffed animal, appropriately just named ""puppy"". He even made these shirts for us. ""Strong As The Rock"" and ""Live Like Tater"". He told me every time he gets treatments he wants to be strong like me. I told him he's already way stronger I'll ever be. He just giggled not really knowing what I meant. One day he will.

Spent all afternoon with Tater and his beautiful family. Lots of tears were shed among us. Joyful tears. Grateful tears.

I don't know why things happen the way they do in this life. Gotta have faith that there's a bigger reason or lesson for us. Sometimes I'm not sure. But I can tell you this with all my heart and soul that meeting lil' Tater and all these little kids over the years who for some reason far unbeknownst to me, look at me as their hero - is a thousand times way more important than any movie or any ""thing"" I could ever do or accomplish in my life.

Having this platform to shine a little light on the path that these brave children walk - is by far the best part of fame.

I was on set this morning ready to start our shooting day when I got word that there was a family with a special needs young man named RYAN who was hoping to meet me. They understood that they travelled in unannounced but they were willing to wait all day until I wrapped to meet. That would've 12hrs. Way too long.

So I asked production to hold and walked across the beach to the barriers where they were waiting. When I walked down the stairs, Ryan's mom (pictured here) was waiting with a huge hug! Her tears started to come as she whispered, ""Thank you, thank you"". I met Ryan, his brother and his nurse. What a great and cool kid. Without getting into the details, this kid has waaaaaay more heart, is stronger and tougher than I could ever imagine.

He can't talk much, but he did tell me, ""I love you"" in sign language. I thanked him so much for that love.

I walked away from this family so grateful to have met them and Ryan. I don't ever take meetings like this for granted and when that mama hugged me today and I felt her start to cry... that stuff gets me every single time I hug a parent in these situations, because I'm a parent too and will do anything to make my babies happy and put a smile on their faces.

I know I'm a lucky guy to be in this position and have this platform.

I'm grateful and moments like this will always, ALWAYS be the best part of my job.

Stay strong Ryan and thanks for teaching me how to sign language buddy. Great meeting you and your family.

Then as fate would have it, she was hit head on by a drunk driver - she survived. Her white car was completely totaled and she wound up getting a replacement car of the color she always wanted... Red.

Funny (and gratefully) how things work out the way they're meant to. And still to this day she says that white car saved my life.

1986 in Hawaii. My grandmother, Lia Maivia was running a big tribute wrestling show in my grandfather's honor who passed away 4 years earlier. All the biggest stars in wrestling were there paying tribute - Andre the Giant, Antonio Inoki, Dusty Rhodes and one my heroes - Kerry Von Erich.

It was supposed to be an amazing night, until... I got word that Lars Anderson, who was the champion of my grandmother's promotion decided he was NOT going to lose his title that night to a wrestler named ""Bad News"" Allen. Let me share context with you guys - Lars Anderson comes from a wrestling family known as the Anderson Brothers (Lars and Gene) - and widely considered the legit toughest and meanest SOB's in wrestling. Wrestling historians know what I'm talking about.

In my 14yr old punk brain, I didn't think to keep my nose out of the business, because it's exactly that - business. All I thought was Lars was being disrespectful to my dead grandfather and he needed to get his ass kicked... and I was the one to do it.

I stormed into the locker room where ALL the wrestlers were getting dressed, went right up to Lars and said ""You disrespectful son of a bitch you won't drop the belt tonight, I'm gonna kick your ass all over.."" right at that moment my dad was behind me pulling me away and choking me out (thankfully cause Lars would've f*cked me up). Keep in mind I'm 14yrs old.

I was hysterical, crying and scared. My mom came to the back to console me. People were pissed and I was embarrassed of what I did. The ONE guy who came up to me was Kerry Von Erich and tapped me on the chest and said ""Hey kid, it's gonna be alright"" and he walked off.

Kerry passed away in 1993, but I'll never forget that moment when one little gesture from a hero meant so much to that 14yr old punk kid.

My opponent was the one and only Stone Cold - WWE Universe.

At that time, Austin was the biggest wrestling box office star in the world and our leader who created and ushered in our now infamous #AttitudeEra.

Austin was also an EXTREMELY shrewd and smart business man when it came to his opponents and always had the final say with who he would get in the ring with.

Despite many attempts from a few ""main event wrestlers"" on the roster at that time who complained to Vince McMahon saying ""Rock has no business being in the main event at WrestleMania"", it was Austin who when I went to him and asked how we should handle the complaints, he responded with the greatest answer I'll never forget, ""F*ck those motherf*ckers. We're here to draw and make money and that's exactly what we're gonna do. We draw big money then everyone benefits."" The Rock vs Austin feud would go on to become the #1 box office drawing feud in the history of pro wrestling and the WWE.

Even though I lost the WWE title (which is considered an honor in our business) to Austin that night in my mind I literally felt like I was king of the world. I even celebrated like a wild man by ordering a big ass pizza to my hotel room. 

Today, me and the Texas Rattlesnake are good buddies. Love that dude and I'll always be grateful to him for takin' me under his wing, teaching me the business philosophy that I still utilize today of ""F*ck them we're here to make money"" and making me drink more beer nightly than I've ever had in my life.

Happy to share these ""behind the curtain"" stories with y'all to give you some insight and context to the crazy, complicated and amazing wrestling world that's in my DNA. Again, it's my honor and privilege to ELECTRIFY DALLAS and the #WWEUniverse this SUNDAY at #WrestleMania32.

Not long after this match, I lost the title and was eventually sent home for months to recuperate from an injury - it didn't really matter anyway because I wasn't drawing the company any money nor did the fans care I was gone. 

A week before I was scheduled to return to the WWE, I got a call from Vince who said ""How do feel about turning heel?"" (which means becoming a bad guy). I said ""Great, but I have one request... give me 2 minutes on the microphone on live TV and let me be myself. Be real and authentic. I gotta be me"". Vince said ""You got it"". The following week I cut a promo that was from the heart. Real and authentic.

6 months later I was the hottest heel in the company.

Even though I hated being boo'd out of the building at Wrestle Mania 13, I learned one of the greatest life lessons that still serves me today. Be real. Be authentic. Be me.

Truly my honor to perform this Sunday at #WrestleMania32 for the WWE Universe. as me.

Want to say THANK YOU to everyone out there. Yes, thank you for buying the bags and I'm thrilled you're loving them, but more importantly THANK YOU for buying into the idea of Project Rock and what our story truly is. Which is we are all a project and a daily work in progress with one goal in mind - get better. We get knocked down, but we get back up even stronger.

Think of Project Rock as our house - THE PEOPLE'S HOUSE. In our house will be every tool we need to wake up daily, get better and chase greatness. Yes, we have ""the greatest training shoe of all time"" being designed right now, innovative workout gear and bad ass technology coming from our partners at Under Armour, but in addition to that Project Rock is partnering with organizations that will also tap into ""where it all started"" for us to chase greatness. Because as the old saying goes, ""You can't know where you're going, until you know where you've been."" It all make sense very soon.

Until then, the next thing coming you can enjoy from Project Rock will be.. well, let me just say this: Get some good sleep at night, 'cause in the mornings your ass belongs to big daddy.

It's taken me 15 years of building relationships with CEO's, Hollywood Execs and most important - the people. The people. We have a fundamental ethos at Seven Bucks Productions which is ""The audience will always come first"". Which is what I learned wrestling for pennies in every flea market and barn I scratched and clawed in. (and God bless eating at Waffle House 3xs a day;). 

We still have a lot of work to do socially and as always we're a work in progress with room for improvement - but that said its good that our connection is recognized by global media, because at the end of the day, we never want to just ""play in the game""... we want to change the way the game is played.

Since he's older he's in the main hospital and not in pediatric care. 
We were shooting Baywatch Movie scenes outside of the hospital, but instead of heading back to shoot I called the audible, put production on hold and went upstairs to see this young man.

I walked in and his smile lit up the room! And I mean lit that room up!;) We talked for a while about his family, his school and how hard he's working to eventually graduate AND we talked about how COOL all his scars are from his multiple surgeries - from his head to his chest - those scars are badges of honor and the reminder of how beyond tough this kid is.

Right before I left his mom looked at him and said, ""Christopher I can't give you anything, but I'm so happy I could give you this today..."" and she started to breakdown, which was captured in this pic.

Made me think to give so much credit to these parents who would do anything to take their kid's pain away and ANYTHING to bring a smile to their faces. As a papa bear I understand.

Last week on our very last day of shooting Ballers, my security came over and said ""There's a few officers who've worked for us all day and would love the chance to meet you. One of them has a personal story to tell you."" I said I'd love to meet them and walked over to say hello. I shook hands with both men, took pictures and they graciously said goodbye. As I was walking away, I realized I didn't get the personal story. 

So I called back to one of the officers and said ""I heard you had a story for me?"" He was surprised and turned around and called for him and said ""Sure Mr. Johnson"". He told me in 2008 when I was taking my mom to get her weekly chemotherapy and radiation cancer treatments, he was taking his dad at the same time - who had been diagnosed with the same cancer as my mom. He said, ""You won't remember this but we walked into the hospital at the same time and you turned around, smiled and held the door open for my dad... and you have no idea what that moment meant to him. And me."" 

Officer Arias shared with me that he'd been waiting years to tell me that on that day, after I shook his dad's hand and told him to stay strong, that his dad felt no pain that day. And was once again was a happy man and pain free. Even if just for one day. Mr. Arias passed away from cancer later that year, but his life continues to tell an inspiring story.

I'm always asked ""What's the best part of fame?"" Hands down, it's moments like this.

Y'all take care of each other out there and Officer Arias thank you for sharing your dad's story with me.
