KISS To Honor Hometown Military Heroes During 2016 ""Freedom to Rock"" Tour

Tour Will Kick Off With An Explosive Bang on July 4 at Casino Del Sol in Tucson, AZ

America's # 1 Gold Record Award Winning Group of all time in all categories KISS have partnered with Hiring Our Heroes (HOH) and Veteran Tickets Foundation (Vet Tix) to salute members of the National Guard and military Reserve forces in over 30 U.S. cities during their 2016 'KISS: Freedom to Rock' tour.

KISS will hire a currently serving member of the National Guard or Reserve force to be a ""Roadie for the Day"" for each of the 32 U.S. concerts. In addition, KISS will donate a limited number of tickets to veterans in each community and distribute those tickets through VetTix.org. Veterans and their family members will also have the chance to purchase discounted tickets through Vet Tix. Military discounts will also be available at venue box offices with proof of a valid military ID in select markets around the country. Please note this offer is not available in all cities.

The U.S ""KISS: Freedom to Rock"" tour stops are all home to a large number of Army and Air National Guard or Army, Navy, Air Force and Marine Corps Reserve members. Since September 2001, hundreds of thousands of Guards and Reserve members have been recalled to active duty, and many have deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan. Nearly 900 of these brave men and women made the ultimate sacrifice.

KISS' founder Paul Stanley said ""KISS is celebrating our ""Freedom To Rock"" tour this summer; the same freedom that's been upheld by our veterans and active duty service members""

KISS' other mastermind Gene Simmons stated, ""We are proud to partner with HOH and Vet Tix to highlight the incredible commitment and sacrifices of hometown heroes serving in the National Guard and Reserve forces. Many of these heroes have given a lot—and some have given all—and we will honor them in every town we tour.""

From the President of Hiring Our Heroes and a Vice President at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, ""Our members of the National Guard and Reserve are called upon at a moment's notice and they drop everything to respond. It is fitting that we honor these often invisible heroes in their communities and hometowns as part of the 'Freedom to Rock' tour,"" said Eric Eversole.

""Getting the opportunity to partner with Hall of Fame rockers is an amazing opportunity,"" said Mike Focareto, CEO of Vet Tix. ""KISS fans get much more than live music and a pyrotechnics show; they get a chance to create unforgettable memories with their family and friends. We're excited to make this experience possible to our Vet Tix family.""",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/KISS/photos/a.10150696607291412.455096.64075031411/10154475867931412/?type=3,2016-06-14 11:26:04,367,7,58,347,19,0,1,0,0

On this day in #KISSTORY - June 12th, 1973 - #KISS entered Electric Ladyland Studios in New York to record a demo with legendary producer Eddie Kramer, who worked with Led Zeppelin, The Beatles and Jimi Hendrix. The demo included ""Watchin' You"", ""Deuce"", ""Black Diamond"", and ""Strutter"" and was funded with studio time from Ron Johnsen, as payment for the $1000 owed Paul and Gene for singing backups on two of his projects, Mr. Gee Wiz and Lyn Christopher.

""Eddie Kramer, to us, epitomized the whole British sound, which was what we were looking for. He was the production king of the world"" says Gene. The session was quick but the tape radiated with enough energy to light a city and pulsated like a heart about to explode. ""It was full of attitude,"" says Paul. ""Nothing compares to being vehement and vicious in what you do, and when we were recording that demo, we knew nothing could stand in our way. When the four of us were together, it was like a tank - you could fall in behind us and follow, but you couldn't get in front of us. If you did you got flattened.

The band performed with Savoy Brown at the Sundowner Drive-In Theatre. This was KISS' only concert in Alaska until they returned over twenty five years later on January 3, 2000.

Paul recalls the visit to Alaska:

""It was surreal to get to Alaska expecting blizzards and polar bears, only to find that with heaters near our boots all over the stage, we would be playing outside! Every time we went too close to the heaters, our guitars went completely out of tune!

ALIVE III opens with a bang (literally) to the crunching ""Creatures Of The Night"" and slows down only briefly along the way for a beautiful version of ""Forever"". Performances on songs like ""Deuce"", ""Unholy"", ""Detroit Rock City"" and ""God Gave Rock And Roll To You"", show just how tight and flexible this lineup was both vocally and musically! The album ends with a stellar version of the ""Star Spangled Banner"", featuring some tasty guitar work by Mr. Kulick, which should make any American KISS Fan proud!

Alive III was produced by Eddie Kramer and KISS and was recorded in November 1992 during KISS' REVENGE tour at The Palace of Auburn Hills in Detroit, Michigan, Richfield Coliseum in Cleveland, Ohio and Market Square Arena in Indianapolis, Indiana.",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/KISS/photos/a.10150696607291412.455096.64075031411/10154404036626412/?type=3,2016-05-18 22:43:20,1694,101,222,1571,105,16,0,0,2

At the ceremony in front of fans, friends and family, Paul, Gene and Bruce spoke to the crowd and then left impressions of their hand prints in a block of cement. After adding plates of the KISS logo and their signatures, the stone plaque was later added to RockWalk located at the site of the famed Oriental Theatre now Guitar Center Hollywood. #EricCarr was posthumously inducted into the Rock Walk in 1995 and added to the KISS plaque.

Visit RockWalk's website at http://www.rockwalk.com/ and look up KISS under inductees for some more photos of the induction as well as photos of some of RockWalk's KISS memorabilia including an Ace Frehley Les Paul guitar, Peter Criss' boots and Paul Stanley's Iceman guitar and boots.

Dedicated to honoring those individuals and groups who have made significant contributions to the music industry, Hollywood's RockWalk became a reality on November 13, 1985. At last, the Rock 'n Roll world could claim for itself an institution every bit as compelling as Mann's Chinese Theatre, and the Hollywood Walk of Fame.

Hollywood's RockWalk has honored such creatively diverse and equally as accomplished individuals and groups such as KISS, Aerosmith, Van Halen, Johnny Cash, Dick Clark, Willie Dixon, The Doobie Brothers, Jimi Hendrix and Les Paul.",Photos from KISS's post,photo,https://www.facebook.com/KISS/photos/a.10150696607291412.455096.64075031411/10154402673906412/?type=3,2016-05-18 10:38:34,5158,36,203,4973,160,18,5,0,2

The show before a sellout crowd of over 2500 was the beginning of KISS' first European tour. In addition to shows in England, KISS performed in France, the Netherlands, Switzerland, Sweden, Denmark, Belgium and Germany where the Scorpions were the opening act. KISS wrapped up the tour with a final show on June 6th at Ontmoetingscentrum in Harelbeke, Belgium.

Gene recalls KISS' first visit to England:

""On the way over to our first English tour, I was struck by the notion that this was the Land Of The Beatles. To me, the English Kings and Queens never meant anything. I have always looked at it as an archaic and rather silly posturing about past glories. But as cultural oddities, I suppose it had its own innocence.

Still, I was nervous to set foot on Holy Ground. We got off the jet in full makeup and the fotogs were waiting for us. We came through customs and jumped on street cars at the airport for foto ops.

I was aware it was drizzly and grey. I was hoping that would change in the next few days to sunshine. It didn't.

I've been deployed for 3 months now, with 3 to go. This is just some of the homage I pay to you guys. I wear my KISS patch right above my AFCENT patch. I'm an official member of the KISS ARMY, but I'm Air Force!

PAUL STANLEY Wants To Record New Music And Make Live CD With SOUL STATION.

KISS frontman Paul Stanley was a guest on a recent episode of the nationally syndicated program ""Uncle Joe's Garage"".

Speaking about is latest solo project, an R&B band called SOUL STATION, Stanley said: ""SOUL STATION is a 13-piece band of people who are really like-minded — top-shelf people who have played with Smokey [Robinson], Stevie Wonder, Whitney Houston, Christina Aguilera, John Mayer… the list goes on and on. And, really, what we do is recreate note for note all the great music that is part of, certainly, my foundation. Sometimes it gets overlooked at this point, because people are being spoonfed crap.""

He continued: ""Look, I don't wanna talk about, 'Oh, the music was so great back then,' 'cause this isn't music that necessarily people would expect me to have an affinity for. But the music that we're hearing nowadays that kind of gets passed off as soul or R&B is just a beat on a computer and somebody doing a nursery run that's been tuned, you know, pre-tuned. It's just a different world. And when you hear the FOUR TOPS, or your hear THE SPINNERS, STYLISTICS, DELPHONICS, TEMPTATIONS, SMOKEY [ROBINSON] & THE MIRACLES. That music is amazing and timeless.""

According to Stanley, race shouldn't be a factor in the way people listen to music. He said: ""Great music is made by all nationalities. And certainly SOUL STATION, the cool thing is it's multi-national, and well it should be. I mean, you should be able to close your eyes and not know who's making the music. It's either good or it's not good.""

He went on to say: ""Look, as a kid, I was lucky enough to see Otis Redding, I saw Solomon Burke, I saw THE TEMPTATIONS. And those people had the good. I'm always kind of… I laugh when I hear some of the local talent being interviewed when they come through town to do concerts and they say, 'Well, you know, we sing along with tracks and stuff, because you can't dance and sing.' Well, James Brown did it. THE TEMPTATIONS did it. THE SPINNERS did it. If you can't sing and dance at the same time, it's 'cause you probably can't sing.""

Regarding his future plans for SOUL STATION, Stanley said: ""What I'd love to do is do some new music with the band and I'd also like to do a live CD, 'cause we've recorded everything, and, quite honestly, it sounds as good as anything done in a studio. You can't go wrong with the people that I've got in this band. When you've got three great back-up singers, when you've got three great horn players. The pedigree of everybody in the band… I'm the mutt, but I hold up my end.""
