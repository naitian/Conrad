6934857868_10153848556582869,"Liverpool, UK:  I'm in Liverpool this week, and when I went to bed last night just before midnight UK time (having earlier heard Osmond brother Merrill in a terrific concert at the famous Cavern Club), it appeared that Brits would be staying IN the European Union, as pollsters were universally predicting a 52-48 victory for those advocating staying.  By the time I got up a little after 6am, the news was already rocking the world—the UK voted to get OUT of the EU by the very 52-48 margin by which they were predicted to lose.
It can't be argued that it was decided by a small sampling—a huge 72% of the Brits voted.  
A little while later in the morning, Prime Minister David Cameron announced his resignation.  The stock markets around the world plunged, and the British pound dropped by its greatest dip in 40 years.  (Good thing I brought some US currency to trade!)
Cameron was leader of the Conservative Party, but it was members of the Conservative Party who pushed for withdrawl.  Cameron sided with the Labour Party and the institutions of government and finance.  The majority of the people, including a significant number of Labour Party people, voted to get OUT.  
Why does this matter to YOU in the USA?  Because it was a foreshadowing of what will likely happen in November.  Those who lead the political and financial institutions will push strongly that we ""go along"" our path and elect ""Hellary"" Clinton.  There will be a large number (I believe a majority) who in spite of the uncertainty of specific policies, will vote to kick the political and financial institutions in their wide and arrogant rear-ends.  
The votes in the UK to get OUT of the EU were those of workers tired of seeing their jobs taken by immigrants who didn't share the British tradition, culture, and spirit.  Many of our neighbors across the pond have felt they were losing their country and culture and that unrestricted immigration was changing their nation.  It didn't help that those wanting to stay in the EU branded the ""out"" group as racists or xenophobes.  It was that many long time subjects of the British empire felt that their country was being lost to those who came to claim ""free"" benefits, jobs and education, but who also wanted to ignore what made the UK a great country and economy: its commitment to a moral authority and the rule of law and order.
Sound familiar?  
This debate has deeply divided the UK, just as America has become deeply divided over essentially the same issues of nationalism vs. globalism.  I've been speaking out about this for years—that America can afford to welcome immigrants who want to assimilate into America, but CANNOT afford to lose its culture and country to those who have no intention of speaking English, accepting the American Constitution of fundamental rights of the individual and of private property, and the moral authority based on the Judeo-Christian tradition.  
Some in the ruling Conservative Party, like Cameron, had become more of the ""house cats"" of the ruling class.  They defended multi-culturalism, unbridled immigration policies, and the siren song of globalism.  Blue collar workers and some of the deeply traditional and patriotic British leaders (like Nigel Farage and former London Mayor Boris Johnson) led a revolt against the trend and a move toward a return to a unique and independent United Kingdom.
There is much hand-wringing and panic in the halls of government and finance in the UK.  The truth is, no one really knows what will be the result of the UK getting out of the EU.  But our friends the Brits determined that what they DID know was that if things kept on the way they were going, their grandchildren would live in a UK that wouldn't resemble the one they loved and lived in.  
Listen carefully to the US politicians who speak of doom and gloom about the British vote.  Expect some of the GOP like Paul Ryan and other institutionalists tied to the financial empires to join with Democrats to call the vote ""racist, short-sighted, and dangerous.""  And watch them in November when they get their own comeuppance by an American people tired of watching their jobs disappear to other countries, the middle class getting sucker-punched and losing net worth while the globalist financiers made billions anyway, and while the best answers from the so-called conservative leaders were slashing Social Security and Medicare, gutting the basic constitutional rights of citizens to protect their jobs and their property, and pretending that there is no moral authority for our government.
A big shock in the UK; a big lesson and something to watch for in the United States.",,status,,2016-06-24 06:15:42,6474,358,4681,5960,390,115,7,2,1

6934857868_10153847480197869,"In a big day for news from the Supreme Court, SCOTUS has ruled that universities may continue to use ""race conscious"" admissions practices.
 
Curiously, in 2014 the Court in a 6-2 decision upheld a Michigan law banning race as part of the admissions criteria.  Michigan is one of eight states currently banning race-based admissions.  The inconsistency puzzles Justice Sam Alito, too, as he made clear in his dissenting opinion.
 
But Justice Anthony Kennedy, writing in his majority opinion, said that the University of Texas had met its burden of showing its admissions policy was ""narrowly tailored"" (?) and that such policy was consistent with equal protection.   Sadly, we've gotten so used to policies that fight racism with more racism that we can actually look at ""race conscious"" admissions policies as consistent with equal protection.

Authorities say that he had already been searching stores and online for components to build a pressure cooker bomb, like those used by the Boston Marathon bombers, for an attack in his home state of Indiana.  Interestingly enough, he'd first come under scrutiny by the FBI after he posted videos online of Anwar al-Alawki, the same radical Islamic cleric who was in touch with Fort Hood mass shooter Maj. Nidal Hassan (perpetrator of ""workplace violence,"" according to the Obama Administration) and whose videos were watched by Orlando mass killer Omar Mateen (homophobe and gun owner with no particular religious motivations).

He said it was a good thing none of the victims were armed because if they'd shot back in that dark club, more people might have been killed or injured.  Seriously?  More than 49 dead and 53 injured?!  Has there ever been a more stark illustration of the left's belief that American citizens are too stupid to survive without the government running every aspect of their lives?

The host was Jonathan Karl, and his guest was Connecticut Sen. Chris Murphy, who'd just staged a 15-hour filibuster to push laws expanding background checks and eliminating the mythical ""gun show loophole.""  
 
We're all used to seeing media people put on concerned faces and nod like bobbleheads when politicians mouth this stuff.  It's always presented in such a concerned way, and following a terrible tragedy, that it seems almost rude to point out that their emotional arguments make no logical sense. 
 
So it's almost surreal to see Karl keep pressing Murphy to explain why he's responding to the Orlando attack with laws that would not have prevented it (Omar Mateen passed a background check and didn't buy his gun at a gun show), nor would they have prevented Newtown or Aurora or any other tragic shooting that has been politicized by gun control advocates. In the end, Murphy was reduced to hypotheticals: if these and other laws had been in effect, and if Mateen had done things differently, then it might have prevented the crime.  Maybe, but if the laws had been different, then Mateen would likely have done different things to avoid them.  So what's the real point?  
 
The problem with trying to fight radical Islamist terrorists with gun control laws is that they not only don't obey laws, they kill people with whatever is most effective and convenient, whether that's a gun, a suicide vest, jetliners or pressure cookers.  You can't stop them by banning every tool that might be dangerous; as today's product warning labels inform us, anything can be deadly in the hands of an idiot.

In a career that spanned decades, the comic actress played supporting roles in countless TV shows and movies.  But she was unique in scoring two parts for which she'll always be remembered, one at the beginning of her career and one near the end.  She first came to fame as Rob and Laura Petrie's wacky neighbor Millie Helper.  Thirty years later, looking completely different with big hair and giant glasses, she was Fran Fine's hilarious grandmother Yetta on ""The Nanny.""

6934857868_10153834922952869,"The Philadelphia City Council just voted to put a 1.5-cent tax on all soft drinks.  The argument is that they're fighting obesity, but it also applies to diet sodas, so it's obvious the real reason is money.  Does anyone seriously believe that tax will stay at just 1.5 cents for very long?  A group opposing the tax calls it unconstitutional and hopes to get the courts to reverse it, the way a judge blocked former New York Mayor Mike Bloomberg's ban on large sodas.  
 
But whether the reason for the soda tax is public health or revenue-boosting, the larger point is being ignored: that it's none of the government's business what beverage you choose to wash down your Philly cheese steak.  No more than the IRS should have the power to make you reveal, justify and prove every purchase you make with your own money.  This all springs from the leftist mindset that society can be perfected if only Americans would let their liberal elite betters in government control every aspect of their lives.  In their minds, the money you earn isn't yours; it belongs to the government and they just generously let you use a little of it.  But you'd better use it for things they deem proper, like drinking a kale smoothie instead of a Dr. Pepper.  Sorry, but like the kale smoothie, I find that impossible to swallow. 
 
Besides, if the Philadelphia City Council really wanted to fight obesity, they'd put a $10 tax on Philly cheese steaks.  I actually wish they'd try that.

6934857868_10153834855692869,"This Father's Day marks exactly 20 years from the first Father's Day after my own father's death on the last day of March, 1996.  He missed seeing me sworn in as Governor by 3 1/2 months.  He never met Lauren who would become his granddaughter in law, or Bryan, who would become his grandson in law.  He only lived to see one of his grandchildren (John Mark) graduate from high school, and not long enough to see any of them graduate from college.  And he never saw any of his 5 great-grandchildren (Chandler, Scarlett, Caroline Grace, Huck, or George), but if he had, he would have been proud and would have bragged to anyone who would listen that they really were the cutest kids ever.  (and he would have been right about that!)

I will always remember that first Father's Day after his death and not in a good way.  My world had been turned upside down by the convicction of the then Arkansas Governor and my preparing to assume the office from the position of Lt. Governor.  We were just about one month away from taking the oath, moving our family to the Governor's Mansion, hiring dozens of people to staff the office, and trying to establish an agenda for the state budget and policies.  It was a hectic whirl of activity from early morning to late night.  

Despite all the flurry of things to get done, I had not forgotten it was Father's Day, and as had been my custom for the past 25 years or so, I picked up the phone to call him early in the morning to wish him a Happy Father's Day.  A card and gift would be later in the day.  Without even thinking, I picked up the phone and dialed his number.  And just as it started to ring, the cold chill hit me hard as I quickly hung up and disconnected with whatever person would have been on the other side of that number because I then remembered that he wasn't there.  I knew that, but it was sheer instinct to call and congratulate him on having such a wonderful son, and tell him I loved him.  But for a fleeting moment, it had escaped me that for the first time in my life, there was no one to call that I could call my Dad.  He was gone.  And it wasn't a busy signal or bad connection.  He would never again be on the other end of a phone call.  No more birthdays to celebrate.  Not there for the next Thanksgiving or Christmas.  At age 40, I was now the oldest male in my direct lineage and there was no male upstream from me and never would be.  I had my two sons and a daughter, and the day would come (almost 15 years later) when there would be another generation coming along to bring some continuity to the family name, tradition, and yes, even the tempermant.  

For the sons who read this today, make that call.  If you get a busy signal or voice mail, keep trying.  But make the call.  There will come a day you will try and there will be no one on the other end to hear you say ""Happy Father's Day.""  So say it today.  

Happy Father's Day.

Sometimes it seems that the more outlandish it is, the more likely it is to be true!  And it may be backed up with some excellent reporting.
 
In this case, Trump makes the case that a candidate for President of the United States is being funded by terrorism and oppressive regimes.   Heated political rhetoric, you may say.  Hyperbole.  Not something to be taken seriously.  But, wait --- he's not making this up.  After all, we're talking about Hillary.

The reporters had been flying on that plane for months, but the Obama campaign claimed there suddenly just weren't enough seats for them.

Well, according to the classic musical South Pacific (written in the aftermath of World War II), ""…to hate all the people your grandparents hate, you have to be carefully taught.""
 
Sometimes, hate is taught by one's grandparents, or parents.  Sometimes, hate is taught through Facebook postings and Tweets.  Other times, an imam in a mosque might teach it.  More specifically, Dr. Sheikh Farrokh Sekaleshfar has definitely taught it, while giving a talk at the Husseini Islamic Center in Sanford, Florida, in 2013 about the ""compassion"" (translation:  hate) that good Muslims should show to homosexuals.
 
According to the esteemed doctor, the way to show compassion towards gay people is to kill them.
 
I am not kidding.  According to this Iranian scholar's warped faith, death is the only way that gays and lesbians can be forgiven in the eyes of Allah.  ""We have to have that compassion…let's get rid of them now,"" he said.

The latest news I've received is that the death toll at the gay nightclub Pulse has reached 50, with 53 wounded.  That makes this deadliest mass shooting in US history.  The shooter was killed in a shootout with police.  Please join me in praying for the victims and their families, and that the wounded will recover and there be no more casualties. 
 
The link below has a recap of what happened if you're just getting up on Sunday morning and hearing the news.  The killer was identified as Omar Mateen, a US citizen of Afghan heritage from Port St. Lucie, Florida.  Police say he entered the crowded dance club at 2 a.m., well-organized for an attack and carrying a semi-automatic rifle.  It's being treated as a radical Islamic terrorist attack.  Authorities are usually hesitant to say that so early in an investigation, so there must be some pretty strong evidence.  President Obama has been notified and is receiving regular updates.  I am keenly interested to hear what he will say. 
 
Obama, of course, has become famous for refusing to call obvious acts of Islamic terrorism, such as the Ft. Hood shooting and the San Bernadino shooting, by their accurate names. Western nations have opened their borders and kowtowed to radical ideologies in the name of political correctness and multiculturalism, and we are seeing the deadly results in Europe and now here in America.  How many more tragic attacks will it take, in Europe, Israel and now in America, before self-hating liberal leaders wake up to the fact that radical Islam is a deadly menace, incompatible with Western values?  News flash: there is a real war on gays and women, but it's not Republicans who are waging it.

Warren is being bandied about as the perfect running mate for Hillary because of her extensive executive experience.  Just kidding!  She's just really far left, enough to make Hillary look like an Eisenhower Republican by comparison. Endorsing Hillary now is a shrewd move as it positions her to become the designated running mate early, whether the nominee is Hillary Clinton or Joe Biden, who also endorsed Hillary today while keeping one eye fixed on any news coming out of the FBI.  
 
Naturally, Warren also leaped on the leftist bandwagon by calling Donald Trump a ""loud, nasty, thin-skinned fraud.""

Get used to hearing these responses, over and over.  Because, really, what else can be said?
 
Missouri Sen. Claire McCaskill, in an interview with CNN's Chris Cuomo, dodged some admirably specific questions about the Clinton Global Initiative and the Clinton Family Foundation.   Clinton spinmeisters have turned avoidance into an art form, to be sure.  First, deflect the question.  Never answer the question.  Instead, point out in very general terms the good their foundation has done around the world and the selflessness Hillary Clinton has shown in turning her attention to public service.

To hear her tell it, keeping all her State Department correspondence on her own server and staying ""outside"" the departmental system was no big deal and everybody knew about it.
 
But look more closely at the emails that have been released, and it's easy to see that this is a very big deal indeed.  Though many of the classified ones could be released only after being highly redacted, each redaction came with its own code to explain why the redaction had been made.
 
The redaction code ""B7(F)"" appears on some of the pages that we can see only in blacked-out form.  This code is placed on information that, if released publicly, would ""endanger the life or physical safety of an individual.""  In other words, if this information gets out, people can die.

It's a lovely city, but apparently, Democratic Mayor Sam Liccardo thinks that the targets of violent crime are to blame for it, and the police won't get involved to stop assaults unless they think the victim's death is imminent. 

How else to explain the official reaction to the mob of violent leftist protesters outside a Donald Trump rally last Thursday whose barbarism included physically assaulting Trump supporters?  Mayor Liccardo was quoted by the AP as saying, ""At some point, Donald Trump needs to take responsibility for the irresponsible behavior of his campaign.""  
 
Uh, Mr. Mayor?  It wasn't the Trump campaign that was burning American flags, throwing eggs and bottles, and gang-assaulting innocent people for wearing Trump T-shirts.  Liccardo is a bigtime Hillary supporter, but even Clinton spokesman John Podesta knew where to place the blame for this, saying, ""Violence against supporters of any candidate has no place in this election."" 
 
MSNBC anchor Chris Hayes echoed that.  He called the protesters' behavior ""despicable mob violence,"" said ""people have a fundamental right to attend a political rally,"" and called on the perpetrators to be identified and prosecuted. 
 
So why did the police just stand by and let thugs run wild?  Did California environmentalists bar them from cutting down trees to make billy clubs?  Actually, San Jose Police Chief Eddie Garcia praised the officers on hand for their ""discipline and restraint"" in not getting involved in confrontations that weren't life-threatening.  So the minimum requirement for the police to intervene in stopping an assault in the streets is that it must appear to be potentially lethal?

But the Internet has been lit aflame by animal lovers furious at the parents for allowing the situation to happen.  They've reportedly received death threats and demands that they be prosecuted.  
 
But animal expert and TV host Jeff Corwin points out that it's nothing new.  One study showed that 42% of deaths and injuries from captive tiger attacks involved visitors, many of them kids, and not zoo keepers.  He has an important message for all zoo visitors, especially parents: 
 
""When you go to these places, the zoo is not your babysitter. You have a responsibility.""
 
I wonder if our constant immersion in TV, movies and virtual reality is making people forget how to behave in ""real"" reality. The same obliviousness that allows people to yak on cell phones in Broadway theaters just as if they're sitting at home in front of their TVs is also leading them to assume that real zoo animals are no more dangerous than those in a video game.

6934857868_10153795564132869,"It's always a good idea to ""go to the tape"" and see what someone actually said before letting the Selective Outrage Machine fire up your emotions.  Latest case in point: the attempt to stir up fury over Donald Trump telling a Washington, DC, crowd on Sunday that ""this is our day and we have to be very proud of it.""  That sparked the usual Twitter mobs, spewing accusations in every direction, from Trump not knowing what Memorial Day is to him trying to claim the holiday is about himself.  You can see more of their attacks and get the full story at the link below. 
 
I guess none of these self-appointed experts on Memorial Day realized that it's not on Sunday, it's on Monday.  Trump was speaking at the Rolling Thunder Run, an annual gathering of bikers to call attention to POWs and MIAs that falls on Memorial Day Weekend.  I'd say that Trump was justified in calling that ""our day,"" seeing as they organize it every year, and Trump was an invited participant. But even if he actually had been speaking on Memorial Day and called it ""our day,"" how would that be outrageous?  Of course, it's a day for fallen US veterans, but it's also ""our day"" in the sense that it's our US federal holiday for honoring them, as opposed to South Korea's Memorial Day (June 6) or Newfoundland and Labrador's Memorial Day (July 1).   
 
No wonder so many Americans are fed up with politics when that now provides an excuse to rip people apart on the flimsiest of pretexts.  Instead of using social media to attack a political opponent over a vague pronoun, all those people instead could have joined in to echo the nonpartisan message of Rolling Thunder: to remember American POWs and MIAs. Then Sunday really would have been ""our day,"" as in ""all of ours.""",Trump Kicks Off Memorial Day Speech With a New Line That Draws a Swift Response,link,http://po.st/mXWPhI,2016-05-31 12:30:00,2010,165,260,1888,85,8,11,5,13

Donald Trump gave a press conference breaking down in detail the $5.6 million in donations raised for veterans groups.  And some members of the press corps essentially threw it all back in his face.  In their questioning, contentious reporters did their darnedest to take a positive thing and infuse it with suspicion and negativity. 
 
Not surprisingly, the Clinton campaign referred to Trump's fundraising as a ""stunt.""  I guess we shouldn't be surprised, either, whenever some members of the media do everything short of wearing ""Hillary For President"" buttons to show disdain for the presumed Republican Presidential nominee.  Trump responded to their pit-viper attacks by calling some of the reporters ""losers.""  Then they got even more contentious, and Trump defended his actions.  His last comment before leaving the stage:  ""I find the press to be extremely dishonest.  I find the political press to be unbelievably dishonest.""

6934857868_10153793713842869,"Today is Memorial Day.  The news media are filled with features about the military heroes, famous and humble, who gave their lives across more than two centuries to secure our rights and freedoms and to protect and defend the victims of tyranny all around the world. 
Yet it's depressing to see also so many stories involving disrespect and desecration of veterans' memorials (let's hope the one involving the crosses in Kentucky was an accident and not deliberate).  The linked story compiles several.  
In recent years, political agitators have been disturbingly successful at separating Americans into groups and pitting us against each other.  So it makes sense that they would especially hate what those military heroes stand for: the long, proud tradition of Americans from all backgrounds selflessly coming together in the common defense of the principles that made America a beacon of hope for oppressed people around the world. These men and women are history's greatest examples of putting your personal differences aside for a higher purpose.  And the ones honored on those veterans' memorials made the ultimate sacrifice by laying down their very lives for others.   

But I have a feeling that the tail may have wagged the dog a little too vigorously.  Just as in 1968, the in-your-face defiance of America's traditions of honor and civility has become so egregious, you can almost feel the righteous fury of the vast majority of Americans rising like heat off the prairie.  The manufacturers of American flags feel it: USA Today reports that flag sales are up 15% from last year.  One flag maker said it's not just because it's an election year: ""Most importantly, we feel there's a rise in patriotism.""    

Let's hope he's right.  The anti-American forces may have loud media megaphones, but that are a tiny bunch indeed compared to those who still believe in American principles and honoring those who protect them.  Maybe if we all rally 'round the flag by flying ours today, our massive numbers will become abundantly clear.",,status,,2016-05-30 09:59:41,1242,33,116,1183,30,1,0,26,2

6934857868_10153786443232869,"In light of yesterday's scathing State Department IG report on Hillary Clinton's cavalier handling of official emails, Michael Walsh at PJ Media examines a theory rapidly growing in popularity: that Hillary will be so damaged that Obama will allow his Attorney General to indict her so she can bow out of the race for ""health reasons,"" and Joe Biden will ride in at the last minute to haul the Democrats' vegan tofu bacon out of the fire.   
 
It sounds like a crazy conspiracy theory, but many top Democrats are privately panicking over polls showing Hillary already falling behind Trump (a new PPP poll shows her behind by 2 points in North Carolina), while still struggling to beat Bernie Sanders.  A Hillary-Biden switcheroo would enable the Democratic establishment once again to thwart democracy and deny the old socialist their party's nomination.  Biden could be untouched by the long onslaught of negative ads and snatch a victory for four more years of Obama policies.  Of course, this is predicated on the notion that a majority of voters actually want four more years of Obama policies.

We took a brief honeymoon trip to Eureka Springs, Arkansas, in a borrowed car and then settled into our first home, a tiny duplex apartment on Caddo Street in Arkadelphia, where I was a student at Ouachita Baptist University.  We shared the apartment with another OBU couple and paid $40 a month, which seemed overpriced at the time!  It had been built in the early '20s and it's still standing---and so is our marriage.

The woman claims he gave her pills and wine that knocked her out and molested her while she was drugged.  Cosby's lawyer claims the case is full of holes, there's no evidence, and it was only brought to court because the DA used it as a campaign issue.  But there are about 50 other women who've made similar claims against Cosby.  This promises to be the most-watched trial since O.J., with a once-iconic black celebrity fighting lurid charges that have destroyed his career and reputation, and could get him up to 10 years in prison.  

A protracted trial could even have an indirect effect on the election, since Donald Trump is sure to draw links between Cosby and another '90s icon, Bill Clinton, particularly in the way the media are attempting to dismiss the Clinton accusations as old news.  Expect the statute of limitations to become a hot summer topic.  If so, the long-delayed chickens that finally came home to roost for Cosby could end up leaving egg on the Clintons' faces at just the worst moment.

Sure, most cities have ordinances about panhandling, but they're aimed at stopping annoyance and abuse, not hurting people in actual need.  Working as a cop is one fast way to learn the distinction, to be able to assess people's situations and respond in an appropriate and compassionate way.
 
Trooper Luke Bonin of the Massachusetts State Police had just left the courthouse in his police SUV when he drove past a woman sitting on the side of the road, holding a sign asking for help.  When he drove on by, the woman probably was just relieved he hadn't stopped her for panhandling.
 
No ticket for her --- the trooper had other ideas.  He drove into town (Fall River), picked up lunch for two and drove back to her spot.  When he got out of the patrol car, she started apologizing for being there.  But, surprise, he responded by offering lunch and sitting with her for some leisurely al fresco dining by the side of the road.

Doctors who perform abortions in Oklahoma could lose their licenses or even go to prison.  Gov. Mary Fallin has five days to either sign it, veto it or let it become law without her signature.  
 
Oklahoma has passed several laws restricting abortion that were blocked by courts because they conflicted with Roe v. Wade.  This bill obviously runs counter to that court ruling, but that's the point.  Its sponsors hope it will be appealed all the way to the Supreme Court, as a test case to overturn Roe v. Wade.  But what are the chances the SCOTUS would ever agree to hear such a challenge?

To understand what Hamilton intended, though, we have to go back to 1803.

Praise is flooding in from virtually every political figure who ever worked with Bennett. He's being remembered as wise, kind, a fighter for his constituents and small businesses, a pro-life and pro-family conservative and a true gentlemen, even to his opponents. His votes for the bank bailout and immigration reform made him one of the first Senators to fall to a Tea Party challenger, but even the man who replaced him, Sen. Mike Lee, expressed his condolences and respect for Bennett for his courage in fighting cancer and for spending his life ""in service to others.""

If you'd like to claim one of these free DVDs for your kids or grandkids, please don't wait because supplies are limited.

Despite voter anger over some glaring snafus and polling irregularities, pundits say this restores Hillary's momentum and virtually assures her nomination.  It's amazing they can say that with a straight face, since anyone who makes a living in politics knows that the fix was in for Hillary long before the race even began.  Bernie performed a public service by making it clear to laymen just how little regard the modern Democratic Party has for its namesake, democracy.  But it's been obvious for a while now, as Bernie racked up landslide wins while Hillary was awarded the majority of delegates, that he would have had a better chance of winning if he'd been playing cards against Penn & Teller.   
 
On the Republican side, Donald Trump's 60.2% win in his home state was even bigger than predicted.  But it was also news that John ""I've Only Won My Home State"" Kasich came in second with 25% and Cruz a distant third with just under 15%.  Those can be chalked up to uniquely New York circumstances, such as Cruz's ""New York values"" slam and Kasich winning Manhattan because the few Republicans who actually live there would be considered liberals anywhere else. Still, even though Kasich has no mathematical path to the nomination (at this writing, if NY's delegates are awarded according to the votes – always an iffy proposition -- Trump gets 89, Kasich 3 and Cruz 0, with three still undecided), this makes it harder for Cruz to tout himself as the close-second-and-closing-in viable alternative to Trump.   
 
If the polls are remotely accurate, within a week or so, it will become impossible for Cruz to reach 1,237 delegates before the convention.  That would leave Trump as the only candidate with a chance, but he might fall short as well.  That's when things get really interesting (as in the Chinese curse, ""May you live in interesting times."")  Then the convention will change from a scripted and staged infomercial to an actual political convention in the old fashioned style.  AKA, a dogfight.  

On the other hand, the drama, deals and intrigue could be a ratings bonanza that makes the Democrats' predictable coronation of Hillary look like a tired rerun from the '90s on TV Land.  For the first time in years, voters could get to see how the sausage is made.  That's a bad idea if you like to eat sausage, but it might be just the thing to get millions of Americans excited and involved in politics again.",BREAKING: New York Primaries Deliver Huge Victories For Primary Front-runners,link,http://hucka.be/k1B7XZ,2016-04-20 09:43:14,745,161,117,702,21,3,10,2,7
6934857868_10153712652752869,"I just learned the very sad news that Mrs. Mary Thomas of De Valls Bluff, AR passed away.  I don't expect that name to ring a bell for most of you, even if you lived in Arkansas.  But if you lived in Arkansas, you probably at least heard of ""The Pie Shop"" in De Valls Bluff, where for years a lovely lady we all called ""Miss Mary"" made the best homemade and handmade pies I've ever tasted in my life.  I would go out of my way when traveling in East Arkansas to go through the little town of De Valls Bluff on US Highway 70, right across the street from one of my favorite barbecue joints, Craig's Barbecue.  I'd try to get there early before her steady stream of customers bought out all the pies.  If I wanted to make someone's day, I knew to buy some extra pies and take them back to Little Rock and give them to friends.  When friends of mine from out of state came to duck hunt, part of the ritual was driving over to Miss Mary's ""Pie Shop"" and introducing them to the little shack behind a modest home with a simple and crude homemade sign in black letters that simply said ""Pie Shop.""  First-timers to Miss Mary's would think I was playing a practical joke when we drove up.  ""Are we really going to eat something made in such a place that looks like it might fall down?"" they would ask.  ""You better believe we are!"" I would respond, and then add, because some of the most beautiful things in this life hide in places that aren't that beautiful.""  I never introduced someone to Miss Mary's that didn't thank me.  Not only for the absolute best pie they had ever eaten, but for helping them to break past their perceptions of a humble, hard working, sweet lady who toiled for years in her little kitchen in a shack behind her house making pies.  I guess some people might say, ""Miss Mary was an African-American lady.""  Not to me.  She was just a lady that I loved seeing and talking to, and loved even more getting my fork into a bite of her coconut pie, or (if I got there early enough) one of her fresh fried peach pies.  I wrote about Miss Mary in my book ""Dear Chandler, Dear Scarlett"" and thought as I mourn the loss of this wonderful human treasure, I would reprint that portion of the book.  I can only hope that she taught someone what she knew about making pies.  If not, I'll have to wait until I get to heaven to get one as good as hers!

Here's the section from my book, ""Dear Chandler, Dear Scarlett"":

There is a wonderful lady in De Valls Bluff, Arkansas, named Miss Mary, who has a little building behind her house. it's a humble shack with not much to it except a rather crudely hand-painted sign hanging from the side of the building that simply reads, ""Pie Shop."" Miss Mary has been making pies for nearly fifty years, and out of her pie shop come the best homemade pies i've ever had.

i remember the first time i had her coconut pie. The meringue was so light and airy and it seemed three feet tall and the pie tasted as perfect as any pie could. But Miss Mary also makes a Southern specialty that is becoming a lost art: fried fruit pies. For the uninitiated, a fried pie is not a dessert, but a work of art. When done right, the outer shell is flaky and tastes lightly of flour, while the apple, peach, or other fruit filling is hot and gooey inside. i know this is how fried fruit pies are supposed to taste because that's how Miss Mary makes them.

Now, i wouldn't ask Miss Mary to teach me the ""hermeneutics of rabbinical exegesis"" as practiced in the time of King David. nor would I trust her to explain molecular biology or nuclear fission to me (if you ask me what molecular biology and nuclear fission are, I'll tell you to go ask your science teachers). But if i wanted to learn how to make the most delicious, beautiful, and near perfect pies on this planet, i'd sit down with Miss Mary around her cookstove in the little building behind her house on Highway 70 and ask her to show me how it's done. She would probably explain the art of a per- fect meringue, or the best temperature at which to cook an apple pie, or even the secret to a chocolate filling that isn't sticky. None of this knowledge saves lives, but what Miss Mary does in her little pie kitchen requires as much skill as a surgeon and as much art as a virtuoso pianist. Yes, her pies are that good!

Maybe the surgeon's work will do more good (especially for one's arteries), but i wouldn't ask him to make me a pie. (For the record, i wouldn't ask Miss Mary to take out my gall bladder, either!) the point is some people do work that requires more formal schooling or that pays more money or that gets them more accolades from the public. But the beautiful thing about knowledge is that there's enough for everyone, and we all have something to teach one another.""

If the agencies involved actually use it to open up free market competition and innovation as he claims, then give him credit.  If they use it to impose even more regulations, that would just stifle competition and innovation.  I'm not sure anyone in this Administration has yet figured out the connection between heavy regulation, higher prices, and reduced innovation and competition.  But here's a tip to get them started: if you want to foster real competition and innovation, end crony capitalism, in which politically-connected businesses get unfair advantages at taxpayer expense.

Arguments are being heard today in the SCOTUS in ""US v. Texas,"" the case challenging the constitutionality of Obama's executive order to defer the deportation of millions of illegal immigrants.  The Administration claims it's within the President's powers to interpret laws; but the plaintiffs say it's a violation of his oath to faithfully execute the laws and an attempt to usurp Congress' power to write immigration laws. The 5th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled against Obama.  Now, it's being heard by the Supreme Court, which without Justice Scalia is balanced 4-4 between liberals and conservatives.  
 
While we can usually depend on the four liberals always to vote for whatever Obama wants, the four ""conservatives"" include wild cards like Justice Kennedy and Chief Justice Roberts, who've been known to pull bizarre rationalizations out of the air to justify ratifying same-sex marriage and Obamacare, respectively.  If the Court deadlocks 4-4, the Appeals Court ruling against Obama stands, but it can't be used as precedent and the issue could return to the SCOTUS once a replacement for Scalia is seated.  
 
Conservatives who are threatening to stay home on Election Day (or even vote for Hillary!) if their preferred candidate doesn't get the nomination should think long and hard about just how close we are today to having a stacked Supreme Court that would ratify an unconstitutional imperial Presidency.

By this point in the Obama Administration, all the other nations were supposed to love us.  Instead, our allies no longer trust us, our enemies openly taunt us, and our rivals alternately challenge and ignore us.  The latest aggressive act by Russian jets against a US Navy destroyer is a perfect example.  The repeated close buzzing was allowed to shut down a Polish helicopter training exercise.  
 
Under previous Administrations, Russia would not have dared such a provocative act because they knew it would spark serious consequences.  These days, Vladimir Putin is smugly certain that he will face no consequences at all from tweaking Obama's nose.  Some liberals will still defend this weak, ""lead-from-behind"" strategy as cool, calm and mature.  They'll praise Obama's lack of a response by saying he refused to engage in confrontation and kept the peace.

But that streak may be coming to an end, thanks to Cruz's superior ground game and his knowledge of and ability to navigate arcane party rules to rack up delegates, as we've seen in Colorado, Louisiana, Indiana, and as this story details, Missouri.  
 
A lot of Trump supporters and even non-Trump-backing grassroots voters are crying foul over Cruz's ability to gain delegates without the support of voters.  The counter-argument is that this system was already in place, and Trump should've learned to work within it better.  I can personally attest that it's nothing new.  For instance, in 2008, I won the Louisiana primary.  But since no candidate got over 50 percent, John McCain took most of the delegates, as arranged at the early caucuses, long before anyone actually voted.  
 
This kind of delegate shuffling has long been common, but I think what suddenly has people angry is that this time, it's different.In previous years, the party shuffled delegates to the likely winner, to help shorten the bruising primaries and strengthen the frontrunner.  This year, they're taking delegates away from the frontrunner to try to undermine the guy who's getting the most votes.  You can argue all day long that it's perfectly ""legal"" under the party rules, and you may be right.

6934857868_10153702206037869,"No wonder President Obama seldom grants interviews to Fox News.  They ask real questions!  And his self-contradictory responses to Chris Wallace about the FBI investigation of Hillary Clinton's unsecure email server have sparked an uproar across the political spectrum.   Click the link for the quotes and details. 
 
Obama alternately assured us that Hillary didn't endanger US security and that the FBI investigation is completely independent and free of political influence.  But if he's not meddling in the investigation, how does he know what the FBI has found and that it's not incriminating?  One could also argue that since he ultimately will determine whether his DOJ files charges, simply by publicly endorsing her innocence, he sent a signal to the FBI that could be construed as political influence.
  
Most outrageously, Obama dismissed the seriousness of the thousands of classified emails (22 of them ranked ""top secret"") transmitted over her private server.   He said, ""There's stuff that is really 'top-secret' top-secret,"" and ""top secret"" papers that aren't so much, just as ""there's classified and then there's 'classified.'""  He conveniently ignores the fact that under the law, government officials aren't allowed to decide which documents are ""classified"" or ""top secret"" enough to protect and which ones they can ignore security protocols for.  In response to Obama's nonchalant view of handling classified information, fugitive NSA secret-spiller Edward Snowden sarcastically tweeted, ""If only I had known.""   
 
It doesn't help Hillary that a military prosecution was just made public in which Taiwanese-born US Naval Lt. Cmdr. Edward C. Lin is charged with espionage for passing classified documents to another nation, likely China or Taiwan.  The charges were heavily redacted (Hooray, SOMEBODY still cares about not revealing state secrets!), so details are vague.  Under military law, an espionage conviction can bring the death penalty, although that hasn't been carried out in decades.  Nobody is seriously comparing Mrs. Clinton's infractions with someone who allegedly committed deliberate espionage.  But it can't be good PR for voters to read this incredibly familiar-sounding part of the charges against Lin:  
 
""The charge sheets say the officer wrongfully transported classified material, failed to properly store classified material and failed to report the compromise of information classified as secret.""

Some background: the seal features depictions of local landmarks, including the San Gabriel Mission, a historic landmark built in 1777.  It actually has a cross on it.  The cross was removed during earthquake-proofing, and during that time, it was removed from the city seal, too.  After the cross was returned to the Mission, the supervisors voted to put it back on the seal.  Because, well…it's s actually ON the building the seal depicts.  But somehow, depicting a historic mission accurately now oppresses non-Christians.  
 
The ACLU celebrated the ruling as a victory for diversity and the First Amendment (if not history or architectural accuracy).  But does anyone want to lay odds on how long it will be before they get offended again and file another lawsuit, demanding that the seal not include a Catholic mission at all, no matter how historically important it may be?

6934857868_10153678508122869,"According to sources close to President Obama, his lackluster responses to terror attacks stem from his belief that the threat is exaggerated.  He seems to think that if it's not an ""existential threat"" – that is, if terrorists aren't capable of completely destroying America – then we can ""absorb"" a few attacks here and there.  That's a lot easier to think when you and your family are surrounded by armed guards 24/7.  

But ISIS isn't the only vicious thing threatening America. There's also the vicious circle that's created when you have an enemy threat on one side, and on the other, a leader who's more determined to downplay the threat than to stop it.  The more the leader ignores the threat and refuses to call it by its right name, the more emboldened those making the threat become.  For instance, Obama continues to ignore multiple polls showing that most Americans oppose letting in thousands of Syrian refugees, considering the attacks in Europe that grew out of radicalization efforts among Muslim migrants.  If he thinks that won't happen here, then he needs to read a recent George Washington University study that found ISIS is already engaged in an unprecedented recruitment effort on American soil, especially through social media. 
 
Just up through last fall, authorities had identified about 300 American and/or U.S.-based ISIS sympathizers on social media and 250 who had traveled or tried to travel to Syria or Iraq to join ISIS.

It's interesting that a group of people who are so sensitive to any slight that they invent terms like ""white privilege"" and ""micro-aggressions"" to feel guilty about discrimination that they never even realized existed, have the hubris to tell religious groups that they're not really being persecuted so just shut up.

This is one of those videos that take less time to watch than it takes to untangle all the misleading political-speak.  In a nutshell:  (1.) The Clinton Foundation has received millions of dollars directly from Exxon, Chevron and other fossil fuel companies.  Yes, you can argue that those weren't direct contributions to making Hillary President, but who are we kidding?  (2.) The most effective way to skirt federal limits on campaign donations is for many individuals who work at the same company to give the maximum amount to a candidate.  For instance, Goldman Sachs didn't give Hillary's campaign $811,031.  But their individual employees all put together did.  To be fair, there are no fossil fuel companies among her very top donors.  It's mostly Wall Street banks, giant law firms and media companies, like Time Warner, if that makes you feel any better.  (3.) To be really fair, I'd like to ask the fossil fuel-hating Bernie Sanders supporter how she got to that event.  Did she walk or bicycle?  Or take an evil, fossil fuel-burning automobile?  Is there no heating in her home?  Was it built and powered entirely by solar energy?  Does she use anything made of plastics or polyester?

Once he makes up his mind to do something, he lets nothing stand in his way: not political opposition, public disapproval, new information, Constitutional limits on his powers, or even basic common sense.  For instance: once upon a time, he could make a case for shutting down the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay.  He argued that it was a potent tool for terrorist recruitment, and that we could keep tabs on released detainees to make sure they didn't pose any further threat.  But now, everyone else knows better.  Two separate studies found that Gitmo is barely mentioned in terrorist propaganda organs, and it's estimated that up to 30% of former detainees have returned to violent jihadist activities, usually at a high level.  Even Obama's own Defense Department recently admitted that Americans have died at the hands of released Gitmo detainees.  
 
Any yet, despite that, Obama is still determined to vacate Gitmo before he vacates the White House.  The Pentagon just announced plans to release another dozen detainees to two separate, undisclosed countries, at least one of which is reportedly in Africa.  These 12 are among 37 already cleared for release.  They say it's part of closing Gitmo ""responsibly."" That's rich.

6934857868_10153624354707869,"On Thursday, I was on ""The Real Story"" with Gretchen Carlson on Fox News just after blogger Erick Erickson, who talked of the secret meeting he had helped organize in DC to gather political operatives together to in his words, ""stop Donald Trump.""  Fair enough.  Even political operatives and DC insiders are citizens and voters and have every right to support a candidate or oppose one.  But the stated purpose of the meeting was to either stop Trump in the primaries, at the convention, or organize a 3rd party candidate should Trump win the nomination the old fashioned way—by getting more votes than his competitors.  A novel idea indeed—having an election and affording citizens the ""one man, one vote"" rule to elect their nominee.  But what if a select group of political operators don't like the person the voters picked?  Erickson said that ""WE"" (emphasis mine) would get together and find a candidate to run as an independent because ""WE"" would never support Trump.

I was stunned at audacity of an attitude that brazenly declared that the ""WE the PEOPLE"" as empowered in the very preamble to the Constutition had been somehow replaced by ""WE the POLITICAL OPERATIVES.""   You can see my reaction below.


I like Erick.  He's a smart guy.  I honestly thought perhaps his strong emotions about the process had caused him to mispeak when he said ""WE"" (political insiders) would stop Trump no matter what the voters thought.  Translation: The voters are stupid and don't know what's best for them so we'll let them pretend their votes matter, but after we humor them with the meaningless exercise of an election, we'll pick someone that ""WE"" like better.  But then, in response to my comments, Erickson posted THIS on his blog:

""Mike Huckabee says that ""when voters make a decision, you suck it up and accept it.""

""The former governor may not know this, but I'm a voter. And my decision is to oppose Donald Trump. So he can suck it up and accept it. This ""will of the people"" stuff does nothing for me as the will of the people is the very mob rule our founders worked hard to constrain.""

Actually, Erick, I am aware that you are a voter.  And so am I.  And I've been something you haven't been—a candidate for President.  Twice.  I didn't get the nomination either time.  And those darn voters are the reason why.  It never occurred to me that since I really did think they were wrong that I could just get some political people in a secret meeting and maybe get the nomination the ""Soviet way.""  We'll let people think they are voting, but then we'll pick me after all.  

Trump was certainly not my first choice—I was my first choice.  I went from a nice income to zero income, gave a year of my life, asked great sacrifices on the part of donors, staff, and volunteers and gave it all I had and then some.  And the voters chose differently.  I could blame the media for giving me virtually no attention and giving it all to Trump.  I could blame the people who promised their support and urged me to get in the race but who then disappeared into the camps of others because they saw better paychecks, better rewards, or maybe really thought they saw a better candidate.  But in the end, my fate was decided by voters.  The old Democrat political jokester Dick Tuck, who be-deviled Richard Nixon with some of the great political pranks of all time, eventually decided to run himself, for a CA state senate seat in 1966. He finished 3rd in a field of 8 and as the results came in, he uttered one of the most quoted political lines of all time (and forgive the verbatim language):  ""The people have spoken….the bastards.""

Dick Tuck said it for humor.  Today, we have GOP establishment types who are saying it because they mean it.  

We have elections not because the people get it right all the time.  They don't.  But they have the right to make a mistake.  I think they made one by not nominated me.  They sure made one electing Barak Obama and would make a bigger one electing Hillary.  But our system was designed to ultimately keep the power away from an oligarchy and let every citizen participate in selecting their leaders. 

Don't like Trump?  Don't like Cruz?  Don't like Kasich?  Vote differently.  Or don't vote.  But sorry, no matter WHO you are, you only get one vote.",The Real Story with Gretchen Carlson,link,http://www.foxnews.com/on-air/the-real-story-with-gretchen-carlson/index.html#/v/4805782796001,2016-03-18 11:28:31,2048,291,822,1922,80,6,3,4,33
6934857868_10153623915682869,"Like everyone else so far, Democrats are underestimating Donald Trump.  Hillary's speech and the fundraising emails her campaign sent out after Tuesday's results gave us a preview of the kind of conventional scorched-earth campaign she plans to run against him.  I'm familiar with the tactics.  Every race I ever ran in Arkansas was against the Clinton Machine.  But if they expect Trump to stand there and take it, or backpedal and apologize when he's accused of being a sexist or Nazi or whatever, they're in for a rude awakening.  He'll take a page from the Obama playbook, go on offense in unexpected ways, and throw it back in their faces twice as hard.  And with polls showing that many Americans are fed up with political correctness and tired of being called racist if they just want the borders secured and immigration laws enforced, Hillary may discover the old, reliable Democratic dog whistles no longer work.  

It's said that Hillary's people are dancing with glee at the idea of running against Trump because he'll be so easy to beat.  Not to compare Trump with Ronald Reagan, but that's exactly what Jimmy Carter's people thought about him.  They underestimated both their opponent and the American public's level of frustration with smug liberal incompetence.

I suspect that Trump and most of his supporters know that many Muslims are risking their own lives to fight radical Islam. They're probably just frustrated with the constant pressure from the media and groups like CAIR not to say anything negative at all, even about Muslims who openly flaunt their hatred of America and their intention to kill us.  But let's drop the double standard and admit the truth. Condemning all Muslims for the actions of a radical minority is wrong, but so is our current President's refusal even to acknowlege that ISIS is Islamic, when that's what the first ""I"" in their name stands for.

The study found that concern about the effects of unfettered immigration is particularly high among those with only a high school or ""some college"" education.  Again, expect that to be spun as the prejudice of the poorly-educated.

Questioning scientific theories isn't anti-science, it's the very definition of science.  Can you imagine not being allowed to question scientific theories that are tainted by politics?  For example, the Daily Caller reports that some researchers at the University of Oregon have determined that the science of studying glaciers is sexist.   As the abstract of their ""feminist glaciology"" paper puts it, quote: ""Merging feminist postcolonial science studies and feminist political ecology, the feminist glaciology framework generates robust analysis of gender, power, and epistemologies in dynamic social-ecological systems, thereby leading to more just and equitable science and human-ice interactions.""  End quote.  It's important not to be sexist in your human-ice interactions.  You don't want to get the cold shoulder from an Ice Queen.  

Can you imagine being threatened with prosecution if you laughed at that absurd study?  Many real scientists said they were dumbfounded by it.  They thought it had to be a joke, but it isn't.   Well, maybe this will help you keep a straight face.  That study was paid for with over $709,000 in grants of your tax money from the National Science Foundation.

I know, Hillary and Bernie appearing on Fox News seems as unlikely as...well, frankly, there's nothing on Earth as unlikely as that.  Hillary has dodged Fox News for years – but then, she's not used to appearing in any forum where she might face tough questions.  She hasn't even held a press conference with the reporters traveling with her since December 4th of last year.  

Pundits noted that Hillary especially seemed a bit antsy and over-caffeinated.  Although I thought the Fox News moderators went easier on her and Sanders than they did on us Republican candidates.  Maybe they were just so stunned that the two actually showed up that they thought they had to tread softly to keep from scaring them away, like birdwatchers tiptoeing past two rare loons.  

The biggest news to come out of the Fox town hall was when Bret Baier actually questioned Hillary about the classified information on her email server.  She brushed it off by claiming that nothing was marked classified at the time, and that it's all so innocuous, it's absurd that it was marked classified at all.

No, of course they weren't.  The Secretary of State is often the originator or one of the first people to receive sensitive communications.  They aren't marked ""classified"" because nobody whose job is to mark them ""classified"" has seen them yet.  As a top Cabinet official, she was supposed to know that some documents are ""born classified.""

Liberal Congress members who passed financial reform legislation in the wake of the 2008 economic meltdown also claim they had the best intentions for consumers, but devils are streaming out of the details.  I wrote recently about the blizzard of new banking regulations (over 16,000 pages worth in 2013 alone) that's forcing hundreds of small town community banks to close, leaving consumers at the mercy of too-big-to-fail mega-banks.  Now, Obama's Labor Department has proposed a new rule that might block everyday working Americans from being able to access financial advice at all. 
 
Its ""good intention"" is to protect consumers from shady financial advisers who have ""conflicts of interest"" because they receive payment from ""any third party source."" The practical effect is that it could censor financial radio hosts like Dave Ramsey and Suze Ormond from offering advice, because they're not paid by the callers.  A study of a similar law in the UK found that people who had less than $250,000 were left high and dry because most professional brokers wouldn't even talk to them.  This rule obviously seems to violate the First Amendment, but think how much damage it could cause before it finally gets thrown out by the Supreme Court – if the current SCOTUS would even throw out a law just because it's unconstitutional.  If you want to prevent the government from ""helping"" you into the poor house, read about this proposed rule change and let your Congress member know how you feel.  
 
Personally, I'm not surprised that this Administration would want to shut down Dave Ramsey.  He helps people get out of debt by telling them to stop spending money on things they can't afford.

Grammy-nominated singer Joey Feek inspired us with her music as part of the husband-and-wife country/gospel duet Joey + Rory, and inspired us even more with her strong Christian faith as she coped with terminal cancer.  Joey Feek passed away peacefully at home last Friday at 40.  

The inventor of email, Raymond Tomlinson, has also died at 74.  We could all take a tip from him.  He spent his last years raising miniature sheep and wasn't addicted to email.  In fact, attempts to reach his family for comment went unanswered.  Here's an idea: maybe reporters should try mailing them a letter.     

Finally, let me add my voice to the millions who are saying prayers and expressing admiration for former First Lady Nancy Reagan, who has passed away at 94.  It's hard to imagine now, but when she was in the White House, she was often the victim of vicious and unfounded attacks about everything from her wardrobe to her personal medical decisions.  Fortunately, the ugly partisanship long since fell away, and news of her death brought messages of sorrow and praise from across the political spectrum.  

In saying farewell to this strong, talented, elegant lady, we also say farewell to our most emotionally powerful connection to the Reagan Era.  Ron and Nancy married in 1952, and while their lives together had an immeasurable effect on the entire world for decades to come, through it all, theirs remained at heart a love story, one of the greatest of all time.  She was his wife, his sweetheart and his best friend. Ronnie called her his ""rock,"" and she was that, not only during the toughest times of his presidency, including a devastating assassination attempt -- but also during his ""long goodbye"" as she stood by him faithfully while Alzheimer's deprived them of their well-earned happy retirement -- and even beyond his passing, when her own increasingly frail health didn't keep her from acting as a great champion and guardian of his legacy.   

It was hard to picture either of them without the other.  For Nancy Reagan, the long years alone are at an end.  She's where she wanted to be: with her beloved Ronnie once again. And I'm certain he's been waiting for her, too.",,status,,2016-03-08 15:37:00,2990,80,225,2732,150,2,0,105,1

My favorite moment came when Bernie said that when you're white, you don't know what it's like to be poor.  I think Bernie needs to get out of DC and let me show him around where I grew up.  For the record, the white poverty rate in America is 11.6 percent.  That's lower than the national average, but it means there are still about 23 million white people who have a pretty good idea of what it's like to be poor. 

The media proclaimed Hillary the winner, then Bernie immediately went on to win Sunday's Maine Caucuses by 2-to-1.

No words seem adequate.  We've lost our most emotionally powerful connection to the Reagan Era.  Though in recent years, with the coming of advanced age, she appeared increasingly frail, she was no doubt one of the most quietly resilient women --- Reagan's ""rock"" before, during and long after his Presidency --- who have ever served in public life.  I think I'd like to focus for now on her loving relationship with ""Ronnie,"" and how deeply it touches us all on this day.
 
Cynics say if you want a friend in Washington, get a dog, but Ronald Reagan was lucky to have his real best friend at his side throughout his time in politics.  I know what that can mean for one's personal happiness and success, because I can say with no exaggeration that I share such good fortune --- I'm blessed to be married to my best friend.  Obviously, we've seen politicians in our history go far even with a difficult marital relationship (Abraham Lincoln comes to mind, among others), there is just no substitute for the love and support of a loyal spouse when doing the hardest job in the world.  George Will has described Ron and Nancy as ""the most married couple"" he's ever met and relates the story that when Ron would be sitting across the room from her, he'd typically be writing love notes to her.
 
We remember the glamorous parties and Hollywood friends, though it's hard to imagine now that a conservative Republican would have enough Hollywood friends to get up a bridge game.  But the Reagans, shoulder to shoulder, weathered many storms:  unrelenting, hateful criticism from liberals, much of it directed at her personally, and even an attempted assassination that seriously wounded the President.  We know it dismayed and even traumatized her to find that she couldn't deflect the literal ""incoming"" aimed at him.
 
It's hard to imagine either of them without the other, but as her husband slowly disappeared into Alzheimer's, she did find herself alone and missing him with all her heart during that ""long goodbye"" and the quiet, painful years after.  She had looked forward to spending their last years together, with memories of their extraordinary shared adventure, but it was not to be.

His was one of those faces we all grew up with, usually as cops and tough guys, from his serious Oscar-winning performance in ""Cool Hand Luke"" to Leslie Nielsen's sidekick in the hilarious ""Naked Gun"" movies.  But like many actors of his generation, he wasn't just a pretty face or a college-trained thespian.  
 
Right out of high school in 1943, he enlisted in the Army at the height of World War II, hoping to become a pilot.  But he landed in the infantry, served under Gen. George Patton, and earned a chestful of decorations, including two Bronze Stars. He actually planned to make the military his career, and only became an actor by chance.  While working in Armed Forces Radio and Television, he was loaned out as a technical advisor to the Army TV sitcom, ""Sgt. Bilko.""

6934857868_10153581950842869,"For those of you keeping score on Hillary Clinton's emails, this week, the State Department finally finished complying with a judge's order and released the last of her official government emails that passed through her unsecured private server.  The final batch includes 23 documents labeled ""secret,"" which brings the final tally of documents classified as ""confidential"" or higher to 2,079.  Which is 2,079 more than she said there were, and at least 2078 more than would have landed most government officials in serious legal trouble.  
 
But it's not over yet: Judicial Watch has filed a FOIA lawsuit, seeking the tens of thousands of emails that Hillary took it upon herself to declare as personal (yoga classes, wedding plans, etc.) and erase.  The judge said he's inclined to agree with that request. And aside from the FBI investigation (Director James Comey just assured Congress that he is closely involved in that, and while he can't reveal details, it's proceeding ""independently, competently and promptly""), there's also an internal State Department probe into how all that classified information ended up in her emails.  A spokesman said they're not going to ""rush to judgement,"" so it's possible it won't even be completed until after the November elections.  

Let's just hope that voters remember, before they pull the lever for Hillary, that they might be electing the first US President who can't even get a security clearance. Read more here -->    http://hucka.be/3F17ds",,status,,2016-03-02 14:29:00,5814,590,3334,5404,42,94,12,9,253
6934857868_10153581975882869,"There's so much negativity in the news these days, much of it centered around the same recurring themes, such as bad behavior by professional athletes, attacks on cops, and racial tension between African-Americans and the police.  That's why this is such a remarkable story: because it shatters every media stereotype. 
 
It started with a tragedy: police officer Ashley Guindon of Woodbridge, Virginia, was shot and killed Saturday, and two of her fellow officers were wounded, while responding to a domestic violence call.  In her honor, University of Virginia cornerback and top NFL prospect Maurice Canady wrote a tribute on the cleats he wore in the 40-yard dash: ""Officer Guindon – 2/27/16 – Never Forget.""  He gave one shoe to her family and plans to auction the other to raise money to benefit her survivors.  
 
What moved him to do this?  She was a white police officer, and he's a black professional athlete.  According to the standard media stereotypes, he shouldn't care.  Well, they were both fellow Virginians.  Canady's aunt was murdered, so he knows the pain of losing a loved one to violence.  And his cousin is a police officer.  But most importantly, their races and occupations were irrelevant.  He did what he did because Officer Guindon was a hero who gave her life to protect others.  And Maurice Canady is a good man with a great heart. 
 
These are the type of people who should be role models for us all, but because of the news media's preoccupation with negativity, they don't get covered in the news very often.  Maybe our whole society would be better off if they did.",,status,,2016-03-02 11:45:00,4120,163,1255,3823,253,6,0,36,2

Mexico gave us a perfect demonstration of the compassion with which they treat people who cross their border illegally, and if they've apologized for it officially, I haven't heard about it.  
 
This is standard procedure for the Obama Administration.  They're going out the same way they came in: apologizing to other countries for America's alleged shortcomings.
