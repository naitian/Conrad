11777366210_10154186729191211,"When Mata Hari arrived in Paris she was penniless.
Soon she was feted as the most elegant woman in the city.
A dancer who shocked and delighted audiences, as a confidant and courtesan she bewitched the era's richest and most powerful men.
But as paranoia consumed a country at war, Mata Hari's lifestyle bought her under suspicion. Until in 1917 she was arrested in her hotel room on the Champs Elysees and accused of espionage.
The Spy tells the unforgettable story of a woman who dared to break the conventions of her time, and paid the price.

There is no bank with a safe deposit box for them. If I do not enjoy these blessings today, I lose them forever.

God knows that we are artists of life. One day He gives us a chisel, another we may receive brushes and a canvas, and still another day He gives us a pen to write.
But we will never use a chisel on canvas, or pens on sculptures. Each day has its own miracle.

My success and my misfortunes, the bright and the dark days I have gone through, everything has proved to me that in this world, either physical or moral, good comes out of evil just as well as evil comes out of good.

Little excess in too little has ever proved in me more dangerous than the excess in too much; the last may cause indigestion, but the first causes death. I know that I have lived because I have felt, and, feeling giving me the knowledge of my existence, I know likewise that I shall exist no more when I shall have ceased to feel.

My errors thought me  the great art of treading on the brink of the precipice without falling into it.

Dois anos depois de ""Adultério"", Paulo Coelho botou o ponto final no seu novo livro na segunda-feira passada, em seu apartamento, em Genebra.

Com o título de ""A espiã"", o romance chega às livrarias no fim do ano, em lançamento mundial (aqui, sai pela Sextante).

O texto é uma costura ficcional trabalhada por Paulo Coelho a partir de uma troca de cartas de Mata Hari e o seu advogado.

A correspondência entre a dançarina acusada de espionagem durante a Primeira Guerra e o seu advogado foi escrita às vésperas de ela ser executada na França e foi  liberada ao público há 30 anos.

Agora, Coelho deu um tratamento de romance ao texto.

""A espiã"" marca também a estreia dele como capista. A ideia é que a capa acima seja reproduzida em todos os países onde o livro será publicado.",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/paulocoelho/photos/a.241365541210.177295.11777366210/10154083479716211/?type=3,2016-05-08 12:05:17,14999,599,1866,13664,979,271,11,2,1

I was strolling in the gardens of an insane asylum when I met a young man who was reading a philosophy book.
His behavior and his evident good health made him stand out from the other inmates.

I sat down beside him and asked: 'What are you doing here?'

He looked at me, surprised. But seeing that I was not one of the doctors, he replied:

'It's very simple. My father, a brilliant lawyer, wanted me to be like him.
""My uncle, who owns a large emporium, hoped I would follow his example.
""My mother wanted me to be the image of her beloved father.
""My sister always set her husband before me as an example of the successful man.
""My brother tried to train me up to be a fine athlete like himself.

""And the same thing happened at school, with the piano teacher and the English teacher – they were all convinced and determined that they were the best possible example to follow.
""None of them looked at me as one should look at a man, but as if they were looking in a mirror.

""So I decided to enter this asylum. At least here I can be myself.'

That no matter how good a person is,
sometimes they can hurt you & because of this we must forgive.

It takes years to build trust and only seconds to destroy it ..

We don't have to change friends if we understand that friends change..

The circumstances and the environment influence on our lives,
but we are the one who responsible for ourselves..

That you have to control your acts or they will control you..

That patience requires much practice.. that there are people who love us,
but simply don't know how to show it..

That sometimes the person you think will hurt you and make you fall..
Is instead one of the few who will help you to get up..

You should never tell a child that dreams are fake, it would be a tragedy if they knew..

It's not always enough to be forgiven by someone,
in most cases you have to forgive yourself first..

That no matter in how many pieces your heart is broken, the world doesn't stop to fix it ..

May be God wants us to meet all the wrong people first before meeting the right one..
So when we finally meet the right one we are grateful for that gift ..

When the door of happiness closes, another door opens..
but often we look so long at the closed one.. we don't see what was open for us ..

It's true we don't know what we have until we find it, but its also true,we don't know what we've been missing until it arrives..

It only takes a minute to offend someone, an hour to like someone,
a day to love someone, but it takes a life time to forget someone.

Find someone who makes you smile, because it only takes a smile to make a day better,
find what makes your heart smile..

The best future is based on the forgotten past..""",,status,,2016-04-17 23:13:15,69278,1699,38140,62907,5912,329,31,96,3

We need to love. Even when it leads us to the land where the lakes are made of tears, to that secret, mysterious place, the land of tears!

Tears speak for themselves. And when we feel that we have cried all we needed to cry, they still continue to flow. And just when we believe that our life is destined to be a long walk through the Vale of Sorrows, the tears suddenly vanish.

Because we managed to keep our heart open, despite the pain.
Because we realised that the person who left us did not take the sun with them or leave darkness in their place. They simply left, and with every farewell comes a hidden hope.

It is better to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all.

Stay close to those who are not afraid to be vulnerable, because they have confidence in themselves and know that, at some point in our lives, we all stumble; they do not interpret this as a sign of weakness, but of humanity.

Avoid those who seek friends in order to maintain a certain social status or to open doors they would not otherwise be able to approach.

Stay close to those who are interested in opening only one important door: the door to your heart. They will never invade your soul without your consent or shoot a deadly arrow through that open door.

Friendship is like a river; it flows around rocks, adapts itself to valleys and mountains, occasionally turns into a pool until the hollow in the ground is full and it can continue on its way.

Just as the river never forgets that it's goal is the sea, so friendship never forgets that its only reason for existing is to love other people

And don't be afraid of the dark
At the end of the storm, there's a golden sky
And the sweet, silver song of a lark

Walk on through the wind
Walk on through the rain
Though your dreams be tossed and blown

Walk on, walk on
With hope in your heart
And you'll never walk alone
You'll never walk alone

Walk on, walk on
With hope in your heart
And you'll never walk alone
You'll never walk alone
